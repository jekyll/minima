Hey!  

Welcome to my blog. I am Siddharth Jain. You can call me Sid.

##### **Here is my introduction in 3 bullets** 

- I grew up in New Delhi, India and studied engineering at IIT Guwahati
- I currently live in London and work within the content team at [ChartMogul](https://chartmogul.com/){:target="_blank"}
- In my spare time, I love to read, cook, write and spend time with my family

You can read about the 3 defining moments from my life [here](https://www.sid-jain.com/3-defining-moments/){:target="_blank"}. I also summarise a few lessons from my life [here](https://www.sid-jain.com/life-lessons/){:target="_blank"}. You can find more about what guides me [here](https://www.sid-jain.com/inner-compass/){:target="_blank"}. 

##### **Why did I start this blog?**

I started this blog to write about my ideas. I had been thinking about writing a blog for a long time but never really started until mid-2020. 

My primary motivation to write is to get clarity in my own thoughts. Barry Ritholtz aptly summarises this in his post [Why I write?](https://ritholtz.com/2015/05/ritholtz-why-i-write/){:target="_blank"}  

> I write mostly for myself. It’s a process, one that helps me to better understand my own thinking and ideas. Daniel Boorstein, an American historian, once said ‘*I write to figure out what I think*’. It’s a surprisingly accurate quote – until you sit down and put pen to paper (or fingers to keyboard) you have nothing. Not until you have a coherent work with a beginning, middle and end, AND a justifiable premise, AND the ability to defend it to other people’s attacks, you don’t really know what you think. Writing it out is a very, very different process than just having a half formed idea kicking around inside your head.

Like me, if you are somewhat interested in starting your own blog, I would recommend reading [this](https://andrewchen.co/professional-blogging/){:target="_blank"}, [this](https://www.nateliason.com/blog/start-a-blog){:target="_blank"} & [this](https://ofdollarsanddata.com/my-best-advice-to-prospective-bloggers/){:target="_blank"} before getting started.

##### **My habits**

![Getting 1% better each day](/assets/img/Getting better each day.png)

I believe in the power of habits. I believe in tiny 1% gains each day that become exponential gains over time. Here are a few habits that I am building: 

**Daily habits**

1. No phone for the 1st hour of the day
2. Exercise (a short stroll counts too)
3. Fast for 14-16 hours a day (better known as intermittent fasting) 
4. Measure your weight (already lost 14 kgs so far in 1.5 years) 
5. Read 20 pages of any book
6. Spend 30 mins learning something new (e.g. design, coding, product, data landscape)
7. Recap highlights from your books, articles, notes etc. (using [Instapaper](http://instapaper.com/){:target="_blank"} & [Readwise](https://readwise.io/){:target="_blank"})
8. Write down [750 words](https://750words.com/){:target="_blank"} (can be about anything e.g. reflection, gratitude, daily journal, ideas etc.)

**Weekly habits** 

1. Reconnect with an old friend 
2. Sharpen your mind with an [arithmetic exercise](http://arithmetic.zetamac.com/){:target="_blank"}  
3. Declutter your digital & physical workspace (e.g. unsubscribing e-mails, cleaning your desk) 
4. Write a blog or LinkedIn post 

##### **Books I am currently reading**

I tend to switch and read multiple books at a time. The ones I am currently reading are:

1. Black Box Thinking *by* Matthew Syed
2. Liar's Poker *by* Michael Lewis
3. How will you measure your life *by* Clayton Christensen
4. User Experience *by* Cliff Kuang & Robert Fabricant

You can find the full list of books that I have read and 3 key takeaways for a subset of them [here](https://www.sid-jain.com/books/){:target="_blank"}.
