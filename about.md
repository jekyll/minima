In the first two years, the curriculum abstracted several components of Architecture (The site, the tectonics, the program) and separated the work at different scales. The third year aims to combine the different components of Architecture and have the students work at different scales. While the first two years had a modernist approach ( take one element of the Vitruvian triad as the design agenda), the third year will have students take both a pre-modernist approach, where Architecture and engineering issues are treated at the same time ( as it is the case in Vitruvius or Alberti treaties, which talk about proportion), and a postmodern approach where program is multiple, complex, hybrid, and the occasion of design manipulation.

The first year focussed on the relation between buildings – outside-in (ARCH 1101) – or the constructive aspect of Architecture – inside out (ARCH 1102) – and the second year focussed on how the large scale informed the architecture Design whether in the horizontal dimension (ARCH 2103) or the vertical dimension (ARCH 2104). During the first semester of the third year, students will work at both large scale and smaller scale, both from inside-out and outside-in, both with the site and the program, both with tectonics and typological issues.

The courses keep in mind the public agenda of the school.The semester uses the first section as a research output, publicly exhibited, to then be analysed within the design of the second stage of the semester. The early focus being a small scale adaptable housing unit. We will be producing entries for the [Empowered Living Design Competition](https://aiautah.submittable.com/submit/080ccac9-449e-4105-b45a-22a543a2ee2b/empowered-living-design-competition-registration). The competition provides the option for two sizes (400sf & 650sf). It also asks you to consider one of three site conditions: A standalone site, a cluster site, or variations on the accessory dwelling site (please see page 3 of the brief for more details). Our interest in a small scale residential unit is in the details - working out the logistical requirements of the competition to produce a cutting edge residential unit. These efforts will be important in the development of the final half of the semester. Submission is not mandatory but is highly encouraged. Based on the competition brief there will be emphasis on the following: Affordability, Durability, sustainability, livability, and accessibility. We will be using the [2015 International Residential Code](https://up.codes/viewer/utah/irc-2015) as the basis for the design guideline. See [IRC Tiny House revisions](https://up.codes/viewer/utah/irc-2015/chapter/new_Q/tiny-houses#new_Q).

The project requires the following:

● Sleeping Space
● Living Space
● Cooking Space
● Bathroom space including sink, shower, and toilet at a minimum
● Spaces to accommodate storage needs
