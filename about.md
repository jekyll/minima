Hey!  

I am Sid.

##### **Here is my introduction in 3 bullets:** 

- I currently live in London and work as a senior analyst at ChartMogul
- I am passionate about data & charts. In case you are interested, I share one small actionable [data storytelling](https://datadino.substack.com/){:target="_blank"} tip every week. 
- In my spare time, I love to read, cook, walk, write and spend time with my family

You can read more about what guides me [here](https://www.sid-jain.com/inner-compass/){:target="_blank"}, 3 defining moments from my life [here](https://www.sid-jain.com/3-defining-moments/){:target="_blank"}, and a few lessons from my life [here](https://www.sid-jain.com/life-lessons/){:target="_blank"}. 

I list down all of my favourite books [here](https://www.sid-jain.com/books-i-like/){:target="_blank"} and some of my favourite blogs and newsletters [here](https://www.sid-jain.com/my-favourite-blogs/){:target="_blank"}. 


##### **Recent Work**

##### **Why did I start this blog?**

I started this blog to write about my ideas. I had been thinking about writing a blog for a long time but never really started up until the pandemic struck (mid-2020). 

My primary motivation to write is to get clarity of my thoughts. Barry Ritholtz aptly summarises this in his post [Why I write?](https://ritholtz.com/2015/05/ritholtz-why-i-write/){:target="_blank"}  

> I write mostly for myself. It’s a process, one that helps me to better understand my own thinking and ideas. Daniel Boorstein, an American historian, once said ‘*I write to figure out what I think*’. It’s a surprisingly accurate quote – until you sit down and put pen to paper (or fingers to keyboard) you have nothing. Not until you have a coherent work with a beginning, middle and end, AND a justifiable premise, AND the ability to defend it to other people’s attacks, you don’t really know what you think. Writing it out is a very, very different process than just having a half formed idea kicking around inside your head.

Like me, if you are somewhat interested in writing, I would recommend reading the below 3 links before getting started:

##### **My habits**

![Getting 1% better each day](/assets/img/Getting better each day.png)

I believe in the power of habits. I believe in tiny 1% gains each day that become exponential gains over time. Here are a few habits that I am trying to inculcate in my daily routine: 

1. **No digital devices for the first and the last hour of the day —** cutting out digital devices helps me to be more intentional with my time and help reduce eye fatigue
2. **Daily exercise —** even a short stroll counts. Health is my number 1 priority. Apart from helping me stay healthy, exercise also acts as a feedback loop for me to eat better.  
3. **Intermittent Fasting —** fast for 16 hours a day. This helps improve my body's metabolism. 
5. **Read 20 pages of a book —** this helps me focus my reading on content that has a longer shelf life. I wrote about it [here](http://localhost:4000/do-not-read-news/){:target="_blank"}. It also gives me a break from digital screens.
8. **Speedy [750 words](https://750words.com/){:target="_blank"} writing —** this helps me reflect on the past and plan for the future.

##### **A word of thanks**

I would like to thank my mother, Sapna and my wife, Shubha for their support and help in reviewing and editing my posts.
