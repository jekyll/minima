* [28-01-22](https://www.fisica.unam.mx/carteleras/cartelera.pdf) Nicolás is giving the [Manuel Sandoval Vallarta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manuel_Sandoval_Vallarta) seminar at the Instituto de Física, UNAM on Quantum Computational Advantage via Gaussian Boson Sampling.

* [11-01-22](https://twitter.com/PRX_Quantum/status/1480951141680693256) our work in collaboration with Rachel, Bryn, Raúl, Juan Miguel, Trevor and Haoyu on [speeding up the classical simulation of Gaussian Boson Sampling appeared in PRX Quantum](https://journals.aps.org/prxquantum/abstract/10.1103/PRXQuantum.3.010306).

* [06-01-22](https://twitter.com/polyquantique/status/1479587281912614912) **Martin Houde joins** as the first postdoc in the group. Welcome to Polyquantique Martin! 

* [06-01-22](https://twitter.com/polyquantique/status/1478891012244267008) Our collaboration with Abhinav, Arthur, Trevor, Marcel, Marios, Lars, Jonathan, Haoyu, Jens, Dominik, Bill and Ish on [Quantum computational advantage via high-dimensional Gaussian boson sampling](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abi7894) appeared today in Science Advances!

* 15-12-21 Nicolás gave a talk on [Quantum Computational Advantage via High-Dimensional Gaussian Boson Sampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.12474) for Chile's [Millennium Institute for Research in Optics, MIRO](https://www.iniciativamilenio.cl/en/miro-2/).

* [08-12-21](https://twitter.com/polyquantique/status/1468772841722109953) [Mr Mustard](https://github.com/xanaduAI/Mrmustard), a library that we helped develop in collaboration with [Xanadu](https://xanadu.ai), is out. See this [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/polyquantique/mrmustard_examples/blob/main/making_cats.ipynb) where we use it to find a heralding circuit for making a mesoscopic cat state.

* [22-10-21](https://twitter.com/PRX_Quantum/status/1451591689525731333) Our work with Xanadu on [Fast Simulation of Bosonic Qubits via Gaussian Functions in Phase Space is published in PRX Quantum](https://journals.aps.org/prxquantum/abstract/10.1103/PRXQuantum.2.040315).

* [13-10-21](https://twitter.com/polyquantique/status/1448811012011044867) Our work in collaboration with Daniel Grier, Daniel Brod, Marcos Alonso and Juan Miguel Arrazola on [The Classical Complexity of Bipartite Gaussian Boson Sampling appears on the arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.06964).
