* 21-01-25 We have been awarded an NSERC [Alliance Quantum Catalyst grant](https://www.polymtl.ca/carrefour-actualite/nouvelles/6-millions-de-dollars-pour-des-projets-en-quantique-polytechnique-montreal) to study the classical simulation of near-term photonic quantum computers. **Javier** will be leading this project in collaboration with Ra√∫l Garc√≠a-Patr√≥n from University of Edinburgh.

* 08-01-25 **Yanic** starts his masters with us. Welcome aboard!

* [24-12-24](https://x.com/polyquantique/status/1871400149282619662) We end 2024 with not one but two papers on the arXiv! 
	- [Ultrashort-pulse-pumped, single-mode type-0 squeezers in lithium niobate nanophotonics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17708) in collaboration with the group of Raj Nehra and led by our own Martin Houde.
	- [Simulating lossy and partially distinguishable  quantum optical circuits: theory, algorithms and applications to  experiment validation and state preparation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17742) in collaboration with Jake Bulmer and Bryn Bell and co-led by our own Javier Mart√≠nez-Cifuentes.


* 19-12-24 Congrats to **Nicolas** who presented his m√©moire and now holds a Ma√Ætrise  √©s sciences appliqu√©es. Best of luck in your PhD at UOttawa!

* 12-12-24 **Nicol√°s** has been awarded the inaugural 2024 IEEE Montr√©al IEEE Photonics Society Chapter Young Professional Award.

* 14-11-24 Congrats to **Martin** and our wonderful collaborators at NRC, Guillaume, Duncan, Philip, Fr√©d√©ric and Ben. Our work on [Gain-induced group delay in spontaneous parametric down-conversion](https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.133.203601) appears in Phys. Rev. Lett. today. Moreover, Ryan Wilkinson wrote a nice [synopsis of our work for Physics](https://physics.aps.org/articles/v17/s130) and so did Ingrid Fedeli for [phys.org](https://phys.org/news/2024-12-gain-group-delay-multiphoton-pulses.html).

* 13-11-24 Congrats to **Yanic** whose paper on the photon-number moments and cumulants of Gaussian states [appears today on Quantum](https://quantum-journal.org/papers/q-2024-11-13-1521/). This is the first paper from an undergraduate in the group!

* [18-09-24](https://x.com/polyquantique/status/1836542122511778016) Our work with **Yuan** and **Filippo** on [Riemannian optimization of photonic quantum circuits in phase and Fock space](https://scipost.org/SciPostPhys.17.3.082) is finally published on SciPost Physics.

* [05-09-24](https://twitter.com/polyquantique/status/1831401152732393634) Our tutorial on Matrix decompositions in Quantum Optics  [appears in Canadian Journal of Physics](https://cdnsciencepub.com/doi/full/10.1139/cjp-2024-0070).
