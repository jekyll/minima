* 21-01-25 We have been awarded an NSERC [Alliance Quantum Catalyst grant](https://www.polymtl.ca/carrefour-actualite/nouvelles/6-millions-de-dollars-pour-des-projets-en-quantique-polytechnique-montreal) to study the classical simulation of near-term photonic quantum computers. Javier will be leading this project in collaboration with our collaborator, Raul Garcia-Patron from University of Edinburgh.

* [24-12-24](https://x.com/polyquantique/status/1871400149282619662) We end 2024 with not one but two papers on the arXiv! 
	- [Ultrashort-pulse-pumped, single-mode type-0 squeezers in lithium niobate nanophotonics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17708) in collaboration with the group of Raj Nehra and led by our own Martin Houde.
	- [Simulating lossy and partially distinguishable  quantum optical circuits: theory, algorithms and applications to  experiment validation and state preparation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17742) in collaboration with Jake Bulmer and Bryn Bell and co-led by our own Javier Martínez-Cifuentes.


* 19-12-24 Congrats to **Nicolas** who presented his mémoire and now holds a Maîtrise  és sciences appliquées. Best of luck in your PhD at UOttawa!

* 08-11-24 **Nicolas'** work on Accurate Unsupervised Photon Counting from Transition Edge Sensor Signals appears on the [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.05737).

* 14-11-24 Congrats to **Martin** and our wonderful collaborators at NRC, Guillaume, Duncan, Philip, Frédéric and Ben. Our work on [Gain-induced group delay in spontaneous parametric down-conversion](https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.133.203601) appears in Phys. Rev. Lett. today. Moreover, Ryan Wilkinson wrote a nice [synopsis of our work for Physics](https://physics.aps.org/articles/v17/s130) and so did Ingrid Fedeli for [phys.org](https://phys.org/news/2024-12-gain-group-delay-multiphoton-pulses.html).

* 13-11-24 Congrats to **Yanic** whose paper on the photon-number moments and cumulants of Gaussian states [appears today on Quantum](https://quantum-journal.org/papers/q-2024-11-13-1521/). This is the first paper from an undergraduate in the group!

* [18-09-24](https://x.com/polyquantique/status/1836542122511778016) Our work with **Yuan** and **Filippo** on [Riemannian optimization of photonic quantum circuits in phase and Fock space](https://scipost.org/SciPostPhys.17.3.082) is finally published on SciPost Physics.

* [05-09-24](https://twitter.com/polyquantique/status/1831401152732393634) Our tutorial on Matrix decompositions in Quantum Optics  [appears in Canadian Journal of Physics](https://cdnsciencepub.com/doi/full/10.1139/cjp-2024-0070).

* 29-08-24 **Javier**, **Karthik** and **Nicolás** presented posters and an invited talk at [CQICQ-X](http://www.fields.utoronto.ca/activities/24-25/CQIQC) in Toronto.

* 21-08-24 Congrats to **Jiaqi** who presented his mémoire and now holds a Maîtrise <s>of the dark arts</s> és sciences appliquées.

* 25-07-24 **Karthik**'s work on Beyond the parametric approximation [appears in Phys. Rev. A as an editors' suggestion](https://journals.aps.org/pra/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevA.110.013712). Congrats Karthik!

* 14-06-24 Today we publicly release [haarpy](https://github.com/polyquantique/haarpy), our library to perform averages over the Haar measure using Weingarten functions. This work was led by undegrad extraordinaire **Yanic Cardin** in collaboration with our friend Hubert de Guise from Lakehead University.

* 05-06-24 **Martin**'s work on perfect pulsed inline twin-beam squeezers is [published in AVS Quantum Science](https://pubs.aip.org/avs/aqs/article-abstract/6/2/021402/3296397/Perfect-pulsed-inline-twin-beam-squeezers?redirectedFrom=fulltext).

* 23-05-24 Our work in collaboration with Changhun Oh, Liang Jiang and Bill Fefferman from Chicago on [Quantum-inspired classical algorithm for graph problems by Gaussian boson sampling](https://journals.aps.org/prxquantum/abstract/10.1103/PRXQuantum.5.020341) appears on PRX Quantum.


* [13-05-24](https://twitter.com/polyquantique/status/1790387509030965316) New experimental collaboration with **Guillaume, Duncan, Philip, Frédéric** and **Ben** from NRC. Our friends in Ottawa [measured a gain-induced group delay, a tell-tale sign of time-ordering corrections in SPDC](https://scirate.com/arxiv/2405.07909). In collaboration with them, **Martin** developed theory in excellent agreement with their experiments.
