* [18-09-24](https://x.com/polyquantique/status/1836542122511778016) Our work with Yuan and Filippo on [Riemannian optimization of photonic quantum circuits in phase and Fock space](https://scipost.org/SciPostPhys.17.3.082) is finally published on SciPost Physics.

* [05-09-24](https://twitter.com/polyquantique/status/1831401152732393634) Our tutorial on Matrix decompositions in Quantum Optics  [appears in Canadian Journal of Physics](https://cdnsciencepub.com/doi/full/10.1139/cjp-2024-0070).

* 29-08-24 **Javier**, **Karthik** and **Nicolás** presented posters and an invited talk at [CQICQ-X](http://www.fields.utoronto.ca/activities/24-25/CQIQC) in Toronto.

* 25-07-24 **Karthik**'s work on Beyond the parametric approximation [appears in Phys. Rev. A as an editors' suggestion](https://journals.aps.org/pra/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevA.110.013712). Congrats Karthik!

* 14-06-24 Today we publicly release [haarpy](https://github.com/polyquantique/haarpy), our library to perform averages over the Haar measure using Weingarten functions. This work was led by undegrad extraordinaire **Yanic Cardin** in collaboration with our friend Hubert de Guise from Lakehead University.

* 05-06-24 **Martin**'s work on perfect pulsed inline twin-beam squeezers is [published in AVS Quantum Science](https://pubs.aip.org/avs/aqs/article-abstract/6/2/021402/3296397/Perfect-pulsed-inline-twin-beam-squeezers?redirectedFrom=fulltext).

* 23-05-24 Our work in collaboration with Changhun Oh, Liang Jiang and Bill Fefferman from Chicago on [Quantum-inspired classical algorithm for graph problems by Gaussian boson sampling](https://journals.aps.org/prxquantum/abstract/10.1103/PRXQuantum.5.020341) appears on PRX Quantum.


* [13-05-24](https://twitter.com/polyquantique/status/1790387509030965316) New experimental collaboration with **Guillaume, Duncan, Philip, Frédéric** and **Ben** from NRC. Our friends in Ottawa [measured a gain-induced group delay, a tell-tale sign of time-ordering corrections in SPDC](https://scirate.com/arxiv/2405.07909). In collaboration with them, **Martin** developed theory in excellent agreement with their experiments.


* 06-05-24 Welcome **Germain** who is joining as an NSERC USRA student for the summer!

* 01-05-24 Congrats to **Karthik** who has been awarded a [Bourse d’excellence pour étudiants(es) étrangers(ères) (PBEEE)](https://frq.gouv.qc.ca/programme/bourses-dexcellence-pour-etudiants-etrangers-pbeee-2024-2025/) 🎉🎉🎉 .

* 29-04-24 Martin and Nicolás  will be presenting at the [Quantum Information Science and Technology Workshop 2024](https://www.umass.edu/engineering/events/workshop) and also at CLEO.

* 23-04-24 Most of the group will be heading to the [INTRIQ](https://www.intriq.org/events/rencontre-printaniere-2024-de-lintriq) conference. Javier and Karthik will be presenting talks about their recent work!

* 25-03-24 **Javier**'s work in collaboration with [**Hubert de Guise** from Lakehead](https://hdeguise.lakeheadu.ca/) on verification of quantum advantage in Gaussian Boson Sampling is [out on the arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15339).


* 08-03-24 We visited our colleagues at NRC in Sussex Drive.
