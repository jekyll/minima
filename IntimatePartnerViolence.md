<h2>What is Intimate Partner Violence(IPV)?</h2>
Intimate partner violence is a type of violence involving intimate partners, such as couples, family members, close friends or even colleagues. This type of violence has shifted its definition from physical abuse and stalking to exploiting technology in order to track, harass, intimidate, and harm their victims.

<h2>Why we need to pay attention?</h2>
- First, cyber violence can be extremely harmful. It has caused not only mental illnesses but also an increase in the number of teenage self-harm attempts (Swansea University 2018.)

- Second, cyber violence is easily abusible since it can be conducted from a variety of devices such as computers, cellphones, and basically anything that has access to the internet.

- Third, due to the transparency and publicity of the nature of the internet, private information leaking is long-lasting and impossible to remove completely. For example, some private picture leak in Facebook may never disappear in the internet. Furthermore, it leaves a consistent trauma or even PTSD to the victim. 

- Fourth, when private information leaks, the abuser may harrass not only the victom but also others, including family members, closed friends and so on. It would cause catastrophic effect to the social network of the victom.

- Fifth, authorities generally act long after the abuse begins. And since there are only few internet IPV experts within local authorities, it is very difficult to confirm and charge the abuser.  

- All of these lead to the last reason: many abusers believe that they can get away with these behaviors because it can't be proven who did it or rarely a law or regulation would work for their violence. Unfortunately, there is true. Too often, we hear from survivors that the harassment will not be investigated because no one knows what to do or what laws are being broken. (Anderson, 2016)
