If you remove those asterisks, it will go back to normal.\n\nHere are a few more examples:\n- Use two asterisks to make text **bold**\n- Use colons to ::highlight text::\n- Insert ‚Äú#‚Äù at the beginning of a line to make a heading, like so:\n\n# This is a heading\n\n---\n\nMarkdown is a bit quirky, but it‚Äôs great for quickly styling your text while you type. You can also use keyboard shortcuts, which you can find in Edit ‚Üí Markdown.\n\nTo learn more, check out our Markdown Guide: culturedcode.com/things/help/markdown/"
