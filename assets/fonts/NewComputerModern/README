This is a release of a new assembly of ComputerModern 
fonts plus glyphs for non latin alphabets which are considered 
compatible in style to CM fonts. 

=======================================================================
Use with:

\usepackage[default]{fontsetup} (loads the Book weight)
or
\usepackage{newcomputermodern}

OR

\usepackage[olddefault]{fontsetup} (loads the Regular weight)
or
\usepackage[regular]{newcomputermodern} (loads the Regular weight)

OR

\usepackage{fontspec}
\setmainfont{NewCM10-Book}
\setsansfont{NewCMSans10-Book}
\setmonofont{NewCMMono10-Book}

and similarly for the Regular weight.
=======================================================================

The fonts contain Latin and accented latin letters and combinations,
Greek (monotonic and polytonic), Cyrillic, Hebrew, and Cherokee.

As of version 3.90 they are distributed in 10pt size in *all* families
and series and in 8pt size in Roman (Regular Italic Book BookItalic)
and Sans (Regular, Oblique, Book, BookOblique).

The Math fonts (Regular and Book) support fully all Unicode blocks
of Mathematics providing the widest possible Mathematical coverage.

Latest additions/improvements:

Version 3.93

  Provides access to Russian and Greek guillemotleft and guillemotright
using the character variant tables cv3 and cv4 respectively.

  The Math fonts provide the character \varnothing, an alternative to \emptyset,
through Character Variant cv01. The fontsetup package provides the option 
'varnothing' to easily switch to the alternative character.


  It also corrects the width of the character uni2800 in the Braille block.

Version 3.92

Fixes a naming problem of the .fontspec files.

Version 3.91

Fixes a problem with internal names of fonts and families.
The family names now are

NewComputerModern08
NewComputerModern10
NewComputerModernSans08
NewComputerModernSans10
NewComputerModernMono10
NewComputerModernMath

Fixes a bug with fb ligature.


Version 3.90 introduces

---the 8pt fonts.

---It adds support for diacritics stacking in all Latin glyphs and Hebrew (nikud)
in Roman (Regular, Italic, Book, and BookItalic). I thank Manuel Boni for
the suggestion. Diacritics stacking will expand to all fonts
of NewCM in the future but at the current state it provides
also a working set of free fonts so that the unicode TeX engines 
can test their support of this feature. Stacking for Greek and papyrological
work will be added soon, as we fix bugs towards version 4.00

---Cyrillic BoldSans at 10pt has been "fixed" to a true bold instead
of being a stroke expansion, completing similar work done in previous
versions for other scripts.

---Source sfd files are now included in the distribution since there
has been work on composite/accented glyphs to be constructed automatically
in fontforge. This greately reduces the size of the sources and provides
for easier maintenance. This work is not available in all of the fonts
(not in sans yet) but it is already substantial to justify the release.

History of changes follows:

---------------------------------------------------
Version 3.02 fixes a CounterMasks problem that made Acrobat
not opening correctly documents created with the Book weight.
---------------------------------------------------
Version 3.00 provides full support of all Mathematics Unicode Slots
presented in http://www.unicode.org/charts/ adding hundreds of new
glyphs in both Math weights, Regular and Book:
 
Mathematical Symbols
    Arrows (uni2190--uni21FF)
    Supplemental Arrows-A (uni27F0--uni27FF)
    Supplemental Arrows-B (uni2900--uni297F)
    Supplemental Arrows-C (u1F800--u1F8FF)
    Additional Arrows (uni2B00--uni2BFF)
    Miscellaneous Symbols and Arrows (uni2B00--uni2BFF))

Mathematical Alphanumeric Symbols (u1D400--u1D7FF)
    Arabic Mathematical Alphabetic Symbols (u1EE00--u1EEFF)
    Letterlike Symbols (uni2100--uni214F)

Mathematical Operators (uni2200--uni22FF)
    Basic operators: Plus, Factorial (uni0000--uni007F)
                     Division, Multiplication (uni0080--uni00FF)
    Supplemental Mathematical Operators (uni2A00--uni2AFF)
    Miscellaneous Mathematical Symbols-A (uni27C0--uni27EF)
    Miscellaneous Mathematical Symbols-B (uni2980--uni29FF)
    Floors and Ceilings (uni2308--uni230B)
    Invisible Operators (uni2061--uni2064)

Geometric Shapes (uni25A0--25FF)
    Additional Shapes (uni2B00--uni2BFF)
    Box Drawing (uni2500--uni257F)
    Block Elements (uni2580--uni259F)
    Geometric Shapes Extended (u1F780--u1F7FF)
    

If a slot of the above is not covered it should be considered a bug. In this 
case please report the missing glyph/slot. It will be added as soon as possible.

The included file newcm-unimath-symbols.pdf is out of date, since 
the extra symbols can not be shown in this file as unicode-math package 
does not provide yet commands for all these new glyphs. The user can 
consult the Unicode charts at the above link and access the required 
glyph with \char"# where # is the Unicode number of the
slot the glyph belongs to. 
For example, \char"2BDA will give the Hygeia symbol
(uni2BDA) the Rod of Asclepius.
---------------------------------------------------

Version 2.32 adds support for Braille patterns. Both 6dot (uni2801--uni283F)
and 8dit (uni2840--uni28FF) patters are included. They have been added 
in two styles: for sighted persons (such as teachers) in the 
serifed upright fonts and for blind persons in the sans upright fonts.

The Math fonts (both Regular and Book weights) now include upright integrals
in the ss02 StylisticSet. Use with 
\setmathfont[StylisticSet=2]{NewCMMath-Book.otf}
or
\setmathfont[StylisticSet=2]{NewCMMath-Regular.otf}

or use the upint option of the fontsetup package with

\usepackage[upint,default]{fontsetup}

for the Book weight, or

\usepackage[upint,olddefault]{fontsetup}

for the regular weight.

This version fixes wrong liga tables for standard ligatures 
(fi, ff etc) for the Sans family, thanks to Manuel Boni.

It also adds a newcomputermodern.sty file.
---------------------------------------------------

Version 2.3 adds all kerning found in tipa package for the IPA symbols
following a suggestion of Huanyu Liu. Moreover, the letters eth, eng, beta, theta and chi
exists in IPA-style in the fonts and are accessible in the ss05 lookup table since
they are in a different design from the Latin and Greek letters.
You can access this lookup table using the \textipa and \textsansipa commands of the latest fontsetup
package and the default and olddefault options or setup your own.
---------------------------------------------------

Version 2.2 adds Ancient Greek Numerals (u10140-u1018E) to all fonts 
(except Mono & Math). The four numerals that already existed in 
this range (that is u10144-u10147) have been altered to the new
design matching the style of cm but also provide some Ancient Greek flair. 

Commands for accessing these glyphs are provided by the fontsetup package.

The Math font now provides two more symbols that correspond to the commands
\nrightrightarrows (equivalently \not\rightrightarrows)
\nleftleftarrows (equivalently \not\leftleftarrows)
and supported by the defaul and olddefault options of the fontsetup package.
These symbols are not in the Unicode Standard and so they are added in the
Private Area of the fonts. 

A modified file (newcm-unicode-symbols.pdf) based on unicode-symbols.pdf 
by Will Robertson is also provided showing the math glyphs of the font 
in comparison with other fonts found on ctan.

---------------------------------------------------

Version 2.1 fixes bugs thanks to Manuel Boni. It also introduces Old Italic
(u10300--u1032F) in the Sans font. The Serif font now includes additional
ligatures fb ffb ffh ffj ffk fft fh fj ft fk and the same with longs instead of f
in the default liga table (in addition to the default fi fl ffi ffl ff).
It also includes an alternative k (in the cv01 table) and sp ch ck ct st
in the dlig table. Finally it also inludes "end" versions of the letters
a, e, m, n and r in the cv02 table.

--------------------------------------------------- 

Version 2.0 adds hundrends of new glyphs in the Math font matching at 
least STIX fonts in glyph coverage.

The Serif fonts now support Hebrew and Cherokee.

Finally, a long awaited feature, a Book weight for ComputerModern is added
(math included). This is now the default option of the fontsetup package.
It produces slightly heavier output suitable for book production with
high resolution printing.

--------------------------------------------------- 

Version 1.1 concerns mainly a very big number of glyphs added to
the Math font. It is now comparable in glyph coverage 
with other free or commercial Math fonts on CTAN.

Text fonts have been extended to include 
LATIN CAPITAL LETTER SHARP S (U+1E9E)---thanks to Karl Barry.

Finally thanks go to Robert Alessi for providing the fontspec files 
included in this release.

---------------------------------------

Version 1.003 Several fixes in all fonts especially in polytonic regions. 
Ypogegrammeni is the default for all characters including small caps. 
Prosgegrammeni is offered as alt shape in ss01 lookup 
including small caps. If you use the fontsetup package with the
[default] option, capitals with prosgegrammeni are accessible using
the \textprosgegrammeni{<text>} or the {\prosgegrammeni <text>}
commands.

Especially Greek Bold Sans have been considerably improved in a 
true bold and not an extended stroke of the regular. 

Math font has improved its Greek Bold Sans, and a Greek Sans is included
in Private Area as this is not in Unicode standard. The fontsetup package
should support access to Greek Regular Sans letters ushape and oblique
if loaded with the [default] option.

Sans Serif Regular font now provides access to 6 bce and 4 bce Greek capitals
in ss0X lookups. The fontsetup package includes commands such as
\textivbce{}, \ivbce, \textvibce{} and \vibce to access them if loaded
with the [default] option.



---------------------------------------
Version 1.002 for the Mono fonts have considerable improved iota
and all polytonic accents of Greek.

Thanks to Professor Claudio Beccari for providing information 
about the need for this improvement.
