<h2>Which types of apps are used for intimate partner violence (IPV)?</h2>

While some applications are malicious, others are designed to make our life easier by sharing the location with our loved ones.<br>

- <strong>Spy applications</strong>
- Designed to track the user and expose their private information to others without them noticing.
- Can be purchased online and installed on target’s mobile phone
- Some can also gain access to one’s text messages, browser history, and photo gallery.

- <strong>Location tracking applications</strong>
- Designed with the intention of keeping family members & friends closer by sharing location with each other.
- Exp: <em>Life360</em>, <em>iMapp</em>, <em>Glympse</em>
- On Life360’s website, it stated that their mission was to "...bring your family closer with smart features designed to protect and connect the people who matter most."


Location apps like Life360 can act like a <em>double-edged sword</em>, however. While it is great at keeping families close, it is also commonly used for stalking due to its ability to track live location.

Additionally, popular systems like IOS and Android has the function to disable certain app uninstallation, which makes location tracking apps a very good substitute when an abuser does not want to pay for a “spyware.”
