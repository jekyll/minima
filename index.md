title: Quantum Photonics and Information at Polytechnique Montréal
---

Welcome to our website!

We develop the theory and computational tools underpinning the next generation of nonclassical bright light sources and devices needed for building fault-tolerant quantum computers, quantum communication networks and quantum sensors. We work at the intersection of quantum optics, photonics and information. Find out more about our current research in the links below. 

**We are actively looking for undergraduate interns, graduate students and postdocs.**
Have a look at our [research](research) and if you are interested, apply following the instructions in the [team](team) section.
