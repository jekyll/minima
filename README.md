## Installation

Add this line to your Jekyll site's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem "minima"
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle


## Contents At-A-Glance

Minima has been scaffolded by the `jekyll new-theme` command and therefore has all the necessary files and directories to have a new Jekyll site up and running with zero-configuration.

### Layouts

Refers to files within the `_layouts` directory, that define the markup for your theme.

  - `base.html` &mdash; The base layout that lays the foundation for subsequent layouts. The derived layouts inject their
    contents into this file at the line that says ` {{ content }} ` and are linked to this file via
    [FrontMatter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/) declaration `layout: base`.
  - `home.html` &mdash; The layout for your landing-page / home-page / index-page. [[More Info.](#home-layout)]
  - `page.html` &mdash; The layout for your documents that contain FrontMatter, but are not posts.
  - `post.html` &mdash; The layout for your posts.

#### Base Layout

From Minima v3 onwards, the base layout is named **`base.html`** instead of `default.html` to avoid confusing new users into
assuming that name holds special status.

Users migrating from older versions with customized `_layouts/default.html` are advised to rename their copy to
`_layouts/base.html`. Migrating users with additional customized layouts may either update front matter references to former
`default.html` layout or create a new `default.html` layout referencing the current `base.html`, whichever route being the
easiest:

```
---
# new `_layouts/default.html` for backwards-compatibility when multiple
# layouts have been customized.

layout: base
---

{{ content }}
```

#### Home Layout

`home.html` is a flexible HTML layout for the site's landing-page / home-page / index-page. <br/>

##### *Main Heading and Content-injection*

From Minima v2.2 onwards, the *home* layout will inject all content from your `index.md` / `index.html` **before** the **`Posts`** heading. This will allow you to include non-posts related content to be published on the landing page under a dedicated heading. *We recommended that you title this section with a Heading2 (`##`)*.

Usually the `site.title` itself would suffice as the implicit 'main-title' for a landing-page. But, if your landing-page would like a heading to be explicitly displayed, then simply define a `title` variable in the document's front matter and it will be rendered with an `<h1>` tag.

##### *Post Listing*

This section is optional from Minima v2.2 onwards.<br/>
It will be automatically included only when your site contains one or more valid posts or drafts (if the site is configured to `show_drafts`).

The title for this section is `Posts` by default and rendered with an `<h2>` tag. You can customize this heading by defining a `list_title` variable in the document's front matter.


### Includes

Refers to snippets of code within the `_includes` directory that can be inserted in multiple layouts (and another include-file as well) within the same theme-gem.

  - `disqus_comments.html` &mdash; Code to markup disqus comment box.
  - `footer.html` &mdash; Defines the site's footer section.
  - `google-analytics.html` &mdash; Inserts Google Analytics module (active only in production environment).
  - `head.html` &mdash; Code-block that defines the `<head></head>` in *default* layout.
  - `custom-head.html` &mdash; Placeholder to allow users to add more metadata to `<head />`.
  - `header.html` &mdash; Defines the site's main header section. By default, pages with a defined `title` attribute will have links displayed here.
  - `social.html` &mdash; Renders social-media icons based on the `minima:social_links` data in the config file using
    the latest version of Font Awesome Free webfonts via remote CDN.
  - `sub-footer.html` &mdash; Placeholder to allow inserting markup (e.g. deferred scripts) before the `</body>` tag.


### Sass

Refers to `.scss` files within the `_sass` directory that define the theme's styles.

  - `minima/skins/classic.scss` &mdash; The "classic" skin of the theme. *Used by default.*
  - `minima/initialize.scss` &mdash; A component that defines the theme's *skin-agnostic* variable defaults and sass partials.
    It imports the following components (in the following order):
    - `minima/custom-variables.scss` &mdash; A hook that allows overriding variable defaults and mixins. (*Note: Cannot override styles*)
    - `minima/_base.scss` &mdash; Sass partial for resets and defines base styles for various HTML elements.
    - `minima/_layout.scss` &mdash; Sass partial that defines the visual style for various layouts.
    - `minima/custom-styles.scss` &mdash; A hook that allows overriding styles defined above. (*Note: Cannot override variables*)

Refer the [skins](#skins) section for more details.


### Assets

Refers to various asset files within the `assets` directory.

  - `assets/css/style.scss` &mdash; Imports sass files from within the `_sass` directory and gets processed into the theme's
    stylesheet: `assets/css/styles.css`.
  - `assets/minima-social-icons.html` &mdash; Imports enabled social-media icon graphic and gets processed into a composite SVG file.
    Refer [section on social networks](#social-networks) for its usage.


### Plugins

Minima comes with [`jekyll-seo-tag`](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-seo-tag) plugin preinstalled to make sure your website gets the most useful meta tags. See [usage](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-seo-tag#usage) to know how to set it up.


## Usage

Have the following line in your config file:

```yaml
theme: minima
```


### Customizing templates

To override the default structure and style of minima, simply create the concerned directory at the root of your site, copy the file you wish to customize to that directory, and then edit the file.
e.g., to override the [`_includes/head.html `](_includes/head.html) file to specify a custom style path, create an `_includes` directory, copy `_includes/head.html` from minima gem folder to `<yoursite>/_includes` and start editing that file.

The site's default CSS has now moved to a new place within the gem itself, [`assets/css/style.scss`](assets/css/style.scss).

In Minima 3.0, if you only need to customize the colors of the theme, refer to the subsequent section on skins. To have your
*CSS overrides* in sync with upstream changes released in future versions, you can collect all your overrides for the Sass
variables and mixins inside a sass file placed at `_sass/minima/custom-variables.scss` and all other overrides inside a sass file
placed at path `_sass/minima/custom-styles.scss`.

You need not maintain entire partial(s) at the site's source just to override a few styles. However, your stylesheet's primary
source (`assets/css/style.scss`) should contain the following:

  - Front matter dashes at the very beginning (can be empty).
  - Directive to import a skin.
  - Directive to import the base styles (automatically loads overrides when available).

Therefore, your `assets/css/style.scss` should contain the following at minimum:

```sass
---
---

@import
  "minima/skins/{{ site.minima.skin | default: 'classic' }}",
  "minima/initialize";
```

#### Skins

Minima 3.0 supports defining and switching between multiple color-palettes (or *skins*).

```
.
├── minima.scss
└── minima
    └── _syntax-highlighting.scss
```


A skin is a Sass file placed in the directory `_sass/minima/skins` and it defines the variable defaults related to the "color"
aspect of the theme. It also embeds the Sass rules related to syntax-highlighting since that is primarily related to color and
has to be adjusted in harmony with the current skin.

The default color palette for Minima is defined within `_sass/minima/skins/classic.scss`. To switch to another available skin,
simply declare it in the site's config file. For example, to activate `_sass/minima/skins/dark.scss` as the skin, the setting
would be:

```yaml
minima:
  skin: dark
```

As part of the migration to support skins, some existing Sass variables have been retired and some **have been redefined** as
summarized in the following table:

Minima 2.0      | Minima 3.0
--------------- | ----------
`$brand-color`  | `$link-base-color`
`$grey-*`       | `$brand-*`
`$orange-color` | *has been removed*

##### Available skins

Skin setting    | Description
--------------- | -----------
classic         | Default, light color scheme.
dark            | Dark variant of the classic skin.
auto            | *Adaptive skin* based on the default classic and dark skins.
solarized       | *Adaptive skin* for [solarized](https://github.com/solarized) color scheme skins.
solarized-light | Light variant of solarized color scheme.
solarized-dark  | Dark variant of solarized color scheme.

*:bulb: Adaptive skins switch between the "light" and "dark" variants based on the user's operating system setting or browser setting
(via CSS Media Query [prefers-color-scheme](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/prefers-color-scheme)).*

### Customize navigation links

This allows you to set which pages you want to appear in the navigation area and configure order of the links.

For instance, to only link to the `about` and the `portfolio` page, add the following to your `_config.yml`:

```yaml
header_pages:
  - about.md
  - portfolio.md
```


### Change default date format

You can change the default date format by specifying `site.minima.date_format`
in `_config.yml`.

```
# Minima date format
# refer to http://shopify.github.io/liquid/filters/date/ if you want to customize this
minima:
  date_format: "%b %-d, %Y"
```


### Extending the `<head />`

You can *add* custom metadata to the `<head />` of your layouts by creating a file `_includes/custom-head.html` in your source directory. For example, to add favicons:

1. Head over to [https://realfavicongenerator.net/](https://realfavicongenerator.net/) to add your own favicons.
2. [Customize](#customization) default `_includes/custom-head.html` in your source directory and insert the given code snippet.


### Enabling comments (via Disqus)

Optionally, if you have a Disqus account, you can tell Jekyll to use it to show a comments section below each post.

:warning: `url`, e.g. `https://example.com`, must be set in you config file for Disqus to work.

To enable it, after setting the url field, you also need to add the following lines to your Jekyll site:

```yaml
  disqus:
    shortname: my_disqus_shortname
```

You can find out more about Disqus' shortnames [here](https://help.disqus.com/installation/whats-a-shortname).

Comments are enabled by default and will only appear in production, i.e., `JEKYLL_ENV=production`

If you don't want to display comments for a particular post you can disable them by adding `comments: false` to that post's YAML Front Matter.

### Author Metadata

From `Minima-3.0` onwards, `site.author` is expected to be a mapping of attributes instead of a simple scalar value:

```yaml
author:
  name: John Smith
  email: "john.smith@foobar.com"
```

To migrate existing metadata, update your config file and any reference to the object in your layouts and includes as summarized below:

Minima 2.x    | Minima 3.0
------------- | -------------------
`site.author` | `site.author.name`
`site.email`  | `site.author.email`


### Social networks

You can add links to the accounts you have on other sites, with respective icon as an SVG graphic, via the config file.
From `Minima-3.0` onwards, the social media data is sourced from config key `minima.social_links`. It is a list of key-value pairs, each entry
corresponding to a link rendered in the footer. For example, to render links to Jekyll GitHub repository and Twitter account (now X), one
should have:

```yaml
minima:
  social_links:
    - title: Jekyll repository at GitHub
      icon: github
      url: "https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll"
    - title: Jekyll at X (formerly Twitter)
      icon: x-twitter
      url: "https://x.com/jekyllrb"
```

where `title` corresponds to the link-title displayed when a visitor hovers mouse-pointer over url / icon and
`icon` refers to the Font Awesome icon id. e.g. `github` corresponds to `fa-github`.

Social platform icons are rendered using the latest version of Font Awesome Free webfonts sourced via remote CDN.
The full list of available social icons can be found at https://fontawesome.com/search?ic=brands


### Enabling Google Analytics

To enable Google Analytics, add the following lines to your Jekyll site:

```yaml
  google_analytics: UA-NNNNNNNN-N
```

Google Analytics will only appear in production, i.e., `JEKYLL_ENV=production`

### Enabling Excerpts on the Home Page

To display post-excerpts on the Home Page, simply set `show_excepts` under top-level key `minima` to `true` in your
`_config.yml`:

```yaml
minima:
  show_excerpts: true
```
