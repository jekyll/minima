#### **Book reading philosophy**

My book reading philosophy continues to evolve. I share 2 high-level ideas that I believe in: 

- When reading books, the most important thing is to read books that you enjoy. If you don't, you'll always procrastinate reading. Don't feel compelled to finish a book that you have started. Move on. It is ok to stop reading a book midway for any reason. Personally, I have come to accept the fact that more than half of the books that I will buy will go unread.
- Books are an investment. I don't worry about the cost of a book when buying one. You shouldn't too. A good book can materially change your life.
