Back in the day, I spent almost all my reading time reading news. I believed that reading news made you smart. I believed that it was a perfect productive activity. I could not have been more wrong. There are hardly any learnings from news that stick around. What news does though, is that it makes you more aware of your surroundings. Nothing more. Almost all news has near zero shelf life i.e. things that are newsworthy today are old tomorrow. 

Instead of wasting hours reading news, focus your time on reading something more enduring (e.g. books). You should read stuff that is relevant today and is going to be relevant even 10 years from now.
