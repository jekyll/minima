Here are my priorities:

#### **1. Healthy Life**

- **Health is my top priority.** There is nothing more important than my health. There is no wealth, no fame, no power without good health. Health precedes everything else.

#### **2. Financial Independence**

- **I value financial independence.** Not because I want a big car or big house, but I want the ability to control my time. 

#### **3. Autonomy**


#### **4. Life with minimal conflict**

- **I have found that conflict makes me ancxious.** Hence I want to live a life with reduced conflict as much as possible. But there are times when I need to stand up for my principles & priorities. This is not ideal. And I will with a strong resolve.
