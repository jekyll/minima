---

🤔💡 + 🤔🛠️ + 🤔📱 = 🧘⬆️

Humanity deserves the **📚resources, 🤝communities, 🧩🧱building blocks and 🛒products** that will help accelerate its use of 🔌electrical 📱technologies to ⬆️raise its 🧘consciousness.

"Raising consciousness" could simply be though of as coming to a state where one is able to do and feel however one deeply, truly wants.

Some specific examples could be the following:

Considering how to provide a solution that increases consciousness would just require considering one more variable when designing:

More broadly, all phases of the lifecycle of the technology can be designed to increase consiousness, like:

- Defining requirements
- Designing solutions
- Building
- Testing
- The experience of using the technology
- The experience when not using the technology directly
- End of life

And finally, existing technologies can be modified to help increase consciousness, with new features or configuration options.
