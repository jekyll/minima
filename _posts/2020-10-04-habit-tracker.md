Many of you might have come across the book Atomic Habits by James Clear. James' writing is the gold standard for everything related to habits. 

In his book, James makes the case for [tiny consistent habits](https://jamesclear.com/habits){:target="_blank"} that compound and change your life.

Building upon that, I want to share with you a tool that will help you track your habits.  

#### **A tool that can change your life**

It is an excel sheet that you can use to track your habits. Both I and my wife have been using it for months. It has worked wonders.

#### **3 features worth highlighting** 

Before creating this sheet, I tried many apps to track my habits. Unfortunately, none of them worked. I really wanted my habit tracker to have these 3 features.  

1. **Flexibility —**  Ability to keep track of daily, weekly, and monthly habits. Ability to modify, delete, or add as many habits as you want. Access to the tracker on any device at any time 
2. **Analytics —**  Ability to analyze raw data (eg. hit ratios daily and over time)  
3. **Notes —** Ability to add customized notes on your habits

The excel sheet has all these features. 

#### **Get started**

Here are 4 easy steps to get you started. 

1. Make a copy of the [sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xQd2uBECCaiVJLBC5aaMa4lrMl4SHlrrGIJNXu-DYRc/edit?usp=sharing){:target="_blank"}

2. Start by listing down the habits that you want to track

3. Enter the date (preferably a Monday because the sheet also tracks weekly habits) 

4. Enter 1 if you succeeded, 0 if not
