Many of you might have come across the book Atomic Habits by James Clear. James' writing is the gold standard for everything related to habits. 

In his book, James makes the case for [tiny consistent habits](https://jamesclear.com/habits){:target="_blank"} that compound and change your life.

He talks about how the [Seinfeld strategy can help you stop procrastinating](https://jamesclear.com/stop-procrastinating-seinfeld-strategy){:target="_blank"}

Building upon that, I want to share with you a tool that will help you implement the Seinfeld strategy. [Here is the link.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xQd2uBECCaiVJLBC5aaMa4lrMl4SHlrrGIJNXu-DYRc/edit?usp=sharing){:target="_blank"}

It is an excel sheet that you can use to track your habits. Both I and my wife have been using it for months. It has worked wonders.

#### **Why use this sheet?** 

Before creating this sheet, I tried many apps to track my habits. I really wanted my habit tracker to have the following features:  

1. **Flexibility —**  Ability to keep track of daily, weekly, and monthly habits. Ability to modify, delete, or add as many habits as you want. Access to the tracker on any device at any time 
2. **Analytics —**  Ability to analyze raw data (eg. hit ratios daily and over time)  
3. **Notes —** Ability to add customized notes on your habits

Unfortunately, none of the off-the shelf apps had these features. The excel sheet has them all. 

#### **How to get started?**

Here are 4 easy steps to get you started. 

1. Make a copy of the [sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xQd2uBECCaiVJLBC5aaMa4lrMl4SHlrrGIJNXu-DYRc/edit?usp=sharing){:target="_blank"}

2. Start by listing down the habits that you want to track

3. Enter the date (preferably a Monday because the sheet tracks weekly habits as well) 

4. Enter 1 if you succeeded, 0 if not
