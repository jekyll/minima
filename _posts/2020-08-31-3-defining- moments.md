Have you ever looked back on your life and wondered, if not for that one moment, would you be still there, where you are today? <br/>

I have, and I want to share with you 3 such defining moments from my life. These are 3 incidents that shaped me for who I am.

##### **The 1st one is from the year 2000.** 

I was 8 years old, studying in 2nd grade in India. I was never good at sports. I had terrible handwriting. And I was on a downward spiral academically. Within months, I moved from being one of the brightest in the class to being an underperformer. I was unable to concentrate. My parents got worried. They tried to motivate me with toys, chocolates, and ice-creams but none of it worked.

In the end, it was a doctor that came to my rescue. The doctor diagnosed that the problem was not of motivation, but it was my weak eyesight. The doctor gave me something that would then become a part of my life. Something that I would not be able to live without. My spectacles. 

If not for my spectacles, it would be impossible for me to see and concentrate. My spectacles changed my appearance and my life forever.

##### **The 2nd incident took place on a dull winter evening in 2008.** 

I was at a friend’s place playing Super Mario when a green coloured book lying on the table caught my attention. The book contained an interesting set of mathematics & science puzzles. The conversations that followed got me interested in the amazing world of science and technology. At that moment I decided to pursue engineering. It was the starting point for a 2-year-long race to study for the entrance examination for the prestigious Indian Institute of Technology (IIT). 

I got admitted into the IITs and was transformed. Not only academically, but holistically. My friends, my habits, my thinking, and my knowledge are thanks to those 4 years. From nearly drowning in a river, to being abused at. From college politics and red tape to lifelong friends, it was a thrilling roller coaster ride that started from that one moment.

##### **The 3rd and final incident that I want to share with you is from the year 2015.** 

A new city, a new culture, and new people. I was on a short business trip to London! I was the first-ever from my family to travel outside of Asia. I was really excited. One morning, at work, my boss took me for a coffee. In a mellow voice, he gave me 3 suggestions. The 1st one, “Sid you should only wear plain white, blue or pink shirts to work instead of your bright blue and white check”. The 2nd, “Sid you should buy yourself a pair of black shoes that have laces on them”. The 3rd, “Sid you should match the colour of your socks to that of your trousers”. 

That moment I had 2 choices - I could either take the suggestions as a personal attack and push back or I could take them constructively. The choice I made, made all the difference. I realized that when someone gives you feedback, they really care about you. They want you to become better. I implemented the changes and that has helped me better blend within the community here in London.

#### **Each incident changed me and has had a profound impact on my life.** 

It changed the way I look, it changed the way I think and most importantly it changed who I am. As the Greek philosopher, Heraclitus said, *“The only thing that is constant is change”.*
