This is a post about what worked for me? 

Before I go ahead, a disclosure. I am neither a doctor, nor a fitness trainer. Take any of what I say with a pinch of salt. 

#### **Simple equation that governs weight loss** 

Let me introduce you to a simple equation that governs weight loss.

**_Loss in body weight = Total Energy Out - Total Energy In_**

You lose body weight when you spend more energy than you consume i.e. Total Energy Out > Total Energy In. You gain weight when you consume more energy than you spend i.e. Total Energy Out < Total Energy In. 

Losing weight is not complex. To lose weight, you simply need to decrease your energy in rate and increase your energy out rate.  

#### **How to decrease your energy in rate?** 

Here are a few things that helped me decrease my energy in rate: 

- **Intermittent Fasting** — Reduce the number of hours during which you consume food. I followed 16/8 intermittent fasting i.e. 16 hour fasting followed by an 8 hour interval where I ate food. Naturally, having a smaller window during which I ate food meant that I consumed less calories.  

- **Take in more protein & fibre, cut out the carbs** — Protein helps you feel fuller for longer. Fibre helps in digestion. Increase their quantity in your meeals. Carbohydrates make you feel lousy. They make you feel hungry fast. Decrease their quantity. Ultimately, you'll need to maintain a good balance. A quick google search will help you with nutrition facts. 

- **Reducing calorie desnse foods** — Some foods have much higher calories than your realize. One if them is dairy. Though tasty, it is very calorie dense. Reduce your consumption of food that are very calorie dense. 

- **Cooking your own food.** The surest way to control what you eat is to cook it yourself. You can't be 100% sure of the materials or ingredients that someone else puts in your food. Give restaruants food a pass. Cut outside food. You don't know what ingredients do restaurants use.. cut them out.  


#### **How to increase your energy out rate?**

Here are a few thing that helped me increase my energy out rate: 

- **Intermitten Fasting** - According to some studies, Intermittent fasting has shown to increase the rate of metablosim in the body. So your body consumer more food naturally to keep it running. 

- **Exercise** - I exercised routinely so I spent calories on that. -  Follow a routine. Jess Sims is our favourite insturctor.. 

- **Increaseing Muscle Mass** - While exercising, I focused on exercised that helped increase my muscle mass. As muscles, consume more energy . Thsi increase in muscle continued to an increase in energy that got out. 

- **Give food ample time to digest.** Few hours before gap. 


#### **A few things to keep in mind**

- **Consistency is the key** - for me this was not a one week, one month or even a year long battle. I was trying to lose weight for more than 6 years. I finally got to lose it in year 6. There are going to be ups and downs.. consistency is the key. You need to stick to plan. - Long Term. Weight loss for me wasn't a straight line.. there were always uphills and downhill.. it didn't even move for maybe 3 months. It is not a sprint.. it is a marathon. I tried Keto but it was something that I couldn't do for the long term being a vegetarian..
- Consistency. Consistency is the key/ Consistency. Being consistent was key. Be it Diet Consistence in Diet. Consistency in Exercise. I tried losing weight for 6 years.. but soemthing about this year just worked. Maybe it was the pandemic.

- **Sleep well.** 

- **Measure what matters** - One thing that helped me be motivated was that I measured my weight every day. What gets measured gets managed. So this is something that you need to do as well. What I also did was use a habit tracker excel sheet to track my exercise and weight mesuring regime. 

- **Common Sense** - You know what is right and good for your body and what is not. Just ask yourself. A day or two is ok but don't do a lot. 

In the end, listen to your body. What worked for me might not work for you. Take action. 

In the end, I would be lying if I told you that it was easy. There are no shortcuts. The equation is simple, the work is hard.  

This post is about what worked for me and what might work for you..

I and my wide We start our day with her body-weight strength classes on Peloton are my absolute favourite. Thanks to them and intermittent fasting I have already lost 8kgs this year. In her classes, she routinely shares few words of wisdom Today I wanted to share with you 10 lessons from her workout that are as relevant during the fitness class as much they are in the real world:
- No ego, amigo.
- Scale it down. No ego, amigo.
- The way you do anything is the way you do everything.
- Last set. Best set.
- Don't cheat it. The way you do anything is the way you do everything. Don't half ass stuff.
- I am not sorry
- Don't wish for things to be over. Life is too short. Enjoy the moment. Even the tough ones. Be present. They make you stronger.
- Don't sell yourself short.
- The little things make all the difference. It is not the big stuff.
- Showing up each day.
- Don't quit. Modifying is always ok. Quitting is not.
- Whether during workout or in life don't quit on things. Modify. Pivot. Find a way to get to the finish line.
- Earn your recovery. It is so much better when it is earned.
- Move fast but safely and efficiently.
