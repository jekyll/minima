welcome to notes n obs

this is meant to be my blog: notes on observations or, notes and observations. Also thinking of title nts n obs. but nts might seem like nuts instead of notes

I had a .shopify blog but it was caught up in significant front end gui stuff that made it take longer to deploy blogs. and it was tied to my attempt at a business site where I experimented with selling online and drop shipping.

This is intended to be a personal blog which is not associated with any sort of professional apperance I might have, which you can find here https://www.linkedin.com/in/ian-dodds-945301187/

This will primarily be home  to poorly written write ups which are hastily posted with minimal editing. 

I also think this will be a cool way to learn how Git and GitHub work in addition to manipulating the contents of this site via the command line on my local pc. (I think)

I intend to migrate all my old posts from colonx.co then add a few posts in the works then post whenever.
