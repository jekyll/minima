## Turning 21 (2017)

I've been thinking about being 20. It started terribly. On my first day of being 20, I already had a broken heart I thought would never heal. I didn't know what I was doing with myself as an engineering student trying to do design.

But things got better. I did a bunch of travelling. I made new friends. I learnt new things. I figured out a plan for my life. I worked on some cool projects with some cool people. In retrospect, it's been a pretty good year.

Here's to hoping 21 is great too.
