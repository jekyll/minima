##### **Fear being fired?** 

You are not the only one. In fact, according to a survey in July 2020, 46% of employees fear being laid off. That's an astonishingly high number. What is even more surprising, is that employees of even the most successful companies (FAANGs), live a life fearing lay-offs. As a society, what this points to, is how stressful our lives have become in general. It also throws light on the importance of mental health and why having good mental health today is more important than ever.
