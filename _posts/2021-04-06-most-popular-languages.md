Which are the most popular languages of the world?

<iframe title="Most Popular Languages of the world " aria-label="Bar Chart" id="datawrapper-chart-VW8wl" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/VW8wl/2/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="472"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*='"+e+"']");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}();
</script>

###### **Key Takeaways:** 
 - Only 1 in 6 people in the world speak English. Given, how globalized the world has become I was surprised that this number is still this low. 
 - Chinese (Mandarin) and English are very close in terms of # of speakers.    
 - There is a big market for native language apps and websites, think in terms of users who only speak their native tongue such as Hindi, Spanish, Arabic, Bengali etc.
