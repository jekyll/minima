Sunday evening is coming to a close. I am sitting on my chair and wondering where did the weekend go? Where did it fly by? 

What did I really do? What did I accomplish? The weekend did feel pretty busy. But what was I busy with? 

##### **Reflecting..**

- I was busy cooking 
- I was busy shopping online
- I was busy checking e-mails 
- I was busy cleaning the house
- I was busy talking to my family 
- I was busy watching a documentary
- I was busy checking messages on WhatsApp

I was busy doing a lot of stuff. And that is how the weekend just flew by. 

##### **Why did I feel that I didn't accomplish anything?** 

Although busy, I didn't do anything that felt like growing or learning. None of the activities I did, if done consistently over a year, have the potential to change my life in a meaningful way. E.g. if I were to just clean my house every day for the rest of the year, it would not change my life in any material way. 

To feel accomplished, we need to do something that feels like growing or learning. That is why, before going to bed today, I forced myself to write this blog. I forced myself into an activity (writing) that felt like growth.

##### **I want to ask you** 

Is there an activity that you undertake daily/weekly, which if you consistently do for a year, would change your life? Are you growing?

If not, when will you start? If yes, what activity is it? 

I would love to know. Shoot me an e-mail at j.siddharth24@gmail.com
