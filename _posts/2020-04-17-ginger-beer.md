This is my grandfather's recipe for ginger beer, finely tuned over the years.

### Ingredients
For a batch of 1.2 litres

- 100gm Sugar
- 16gm ginger (washed, peeled, coarsely chopped)
- 1/2 teaspoon yeast
- Water

### Steps
1. Use a hand blender to blend the ginger pieces with some water.
2. Put the sugar and 300ml water in a pan along with the blended ginger and stir to dissolve the sugar. Bring to a boil and turn off the heat.
3. Add another 200ml of room temp water to bring down the temperature, and let the mixture cool.
4. Pass the mixture through a strainer and add the 1/2 tbsp yeast.
5. Put the mixture into a plastic bottle, and top up with water till it's about 600ml. Don't fully tighten the cap because gas will be produced, and it should be able to escape.
6. Leave outside for about 5-6 days.
7. Check after 5-6 days, test for desired sweetness. If it's about right, move to next step. Otherwise let rest for a day and check again.
8. Split the mixture into 2 bottles and top up with water so they're both about 600ml. Tighten the bottle cap and let it rest in the fridge.
9. When you want to drink, pour out the top, clear layer into a separate container. The slurry at the bottom can be reused to make more beer.
