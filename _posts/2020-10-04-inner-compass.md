Inner compass is a list of ideas that guide me. It is a collection of quotes, summaries, experiences, book excerpts and learnings over time. When I am feeling low, stressed out, in doubt, or have a decision to make I come to this for guidance. The goal is to not to remember everything. The goal is for this document to act as my compass in life. 

Most ideas listed in this internal compass are not mine. They have been borrowed from many authors. I am truly grateful for their work.  This post is work in progress and continues to evolve with my thoughts.



#### **Decision Making**

- **It is ok to change your mind.** Ability to change your mind based on existing or new information is a super power. Don't stick on to a bad decision.  

- **Minimize long term regret.**  Will you care about it in the future? One way to differentiate stuff that matters vs that doesn't matter is to ask yourself if you'll care about it in the future? Fake stuff that matters usually has a sharp peak of seeming to matter in the near term but actually does not matter in the future. When making a decision project yourself forward to age 80 and say, "Okay, now I'm looking back on my life. I want to minimize the number of regrets I have".  

- **Optimize for speed.** If a decision is reversible, the biggest risk is moving too slow. If a decision is irreversible, the biggest risk is moving too fast.

- **Over and above all, make decisions.** There is nothing worse than sitting on decision that needs to made. Get better at it. Give yourself +2 for every right decision, 0 for every wrong decision, -2 for every decision that you don't make. Write down the pros and cons of the decisions and make it. 

- **Listen to your gut.** Don’t ignore your instincts. Believe in yourself. Sometimes your intuition already knows what is right.  Don’t let the noise of other opinions drown your own inner voice. And most important, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition, they somehow already know what you truly want to become. Everything else is secondary. 

- **Reduce decision fatigue.** Decision making ability can get fatigued when you use it over and over again. Take the time to plan out, simplify, and automate the repeated decisions. Automating decisions will free up your mental mental space and give you more time for making important choices.  

- **Analyse decisions.** What did you know before hand? What didn’t you know before hand? What were the range of possibilities and what outcome you expected? What happened? 

#### **Goals**

- **Create Anti Goals.** Always Invert. Knowing what you don't want gets you closer to what you want. Each no brings you closer to a yes. A lot of success in life and business comes from knowing what you should avoid eg. bad investments, bad marriage, bad food, bad behaviour etc. Amass long-term advantage by consistently being not stupid. Make a list of things you don’t want to do. Have rejection goals.

- **Complete it or kill it.** If something is important to you, complete it. If not, kill it. Don't be in the middle. Fill your life with goals that are worth finishing and eliminate the rest.



#### **Self Reflection**

- **Be original.** You should strive for an original relation to the universe. Not a novel relation, just your own. Being in a rat race is the worst thing you can do to yourself. Because even if you win the race, you will still be a rat. There is no one out there that shares your same genetic makeup let alone your life experiences. Escape the competition through authenticity. No one can compete with you on being you. 

- **Accept First.** The first step towards getting somewhere is to accept where you are. Next is deciding that you are not going to stay where you are. After that comes the plan. 



#### **Productivity**

- **Perfection is a myth.** Perfection can be enemy of good. Progress is more important than perfection. Make a choice and move on. Just ship. 

- **Look out for 90/10 solutions.**  Look for ways in which you could do 90% of the work with 10% of the effort.  

- **Focus on a few things.** Eliminate things that have little to no payoff. Every minute spent on a task that little or no payoff takes up time, energy, and space that could be put to work for a more important task. Don't let distractions let you half ass things. 



#### **People**

- **Stay away from negative people.** Vibes are contagious.

- **Don't hold onto negative criticism.** Critics will always be loud and clear. It doesn’t matter what you do, there will always be someone who finds fault in it. We are more likely to remember to this negative criticism than praise. When someone is nasty, rude, hateful, or mean with you, pretend they have a disease. That makes it easier to have empathy towards them which can soften the conflict. Sometimes good people act badly. You continue to do what is right. 

- **People are oddly consistent.** If someone treats someone badly it’s only a matter of time they treat you badly. If someone screams over an enemy it is only a matter of time they scream at you.

- **Don't change people.** Don't waste your time trying to change people. Set the behaviour expectation and hold that line. If they don't change, accept and move on. 

- **Look out for 90/10 solutions.**  Look for ways in which you could do 90% of the work with 10% of the effort.
