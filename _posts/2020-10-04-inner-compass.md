Inner compass is a list of ideas that guide me. It is a collection of quotes, summaries, experiences, book excerpts and learnings over time. When I am feeling low, stressed out, in doubt, or have a decision to make I come to this for guidance. The goal is to not to remember everything. The goal is for this document to act as my compass in life. 

Most ideas listed in this internal compass are not mine. They have been borrowed from many authors. I am truly grateful for their work.  This post is work in progress and continues to evolve with my thoughts.

#### **Decision Making**

- **It is ok to change your mind.** Ability to change your mind based on existing or new information is a super power. Don't stick on to a bad decision.  

- **Minimize long term regret.**  Will you care about it in the future? One way to differentiate stuff that matters vs that doesn't matter is to ask yourself if you'll care about it in the future? Fake stuff that matters usually has a sharp peak of seeming to matter in the near term but actually does not matter in the future. When making a decision project yourself forward to age 80 and say, "Okay, now I'm looking back on my life. I want to minimize the number of regrets I have".  

- **Optimize for speed.** If a decision is reversible, the biggest risk is moving too slow. If a decision is irreversible, the biggest risk is moving too fast.

- **Over and above all, make decisions.** There is nothing worse than sitting on decision that needs to made. Get better at it. Give yourself +2 for every right decision, 0 for every wrong decision, -2 for every decision that you don't make. Write down the pros and cons of the decisions and make it. 

- **Listen to your gut.** Don’t ignore your instincts. Believe in yourself. Sometimes your intuition already knows what is right.  Don’t let the noise of other opinions drown your own inner voice. And most important, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition, they somehow already know what you truly want to become. Everything else is secondary. 

- **Reduce decision fatigue.** Decision making ability can get fatigued when you use it over and over again. Take the time to plan out, simplify, and automate the repeated decisions. Automating decisions will free up your mental mental space and give you more time for making important choices.  

- **Analyse decisions.** What did you know before hand? What didn’t you know before hand? What were the range of possibilities and what outcome you expected? What happened? 

#### **Goals**

- **Create Anti Goals.** Always Invert. Knowing what you don't want gets you closer to what you want. Each no brings you closer to a yes. A lot of success in life and business comes from knowing what you should avoid eg. bad investments, bad marriage, bad food, bad behaviour etc. Amass long-term advantage by consistently being not stupid. Make a list of things you don’t want to do. Have rejection goals.

- **Complete it or kill it.** If something is important to you, complete it. If not, kill it. Don't be in the middle. Fill your life with goals that are worth finishing and eliminate the rest.

- **Set the agenda.** Or someone else will. If you don’t decide what you want for yourself someone else will. Don’t waste your time living someone else’s life. You need to be proactive with what you want.


#### **Self Reflection**

- **Be original.** You should strive for an original relation to the universe. Not a novel relation, just your own. Being in a rat race is the worst thing you can do to yourself. Because even if you win the race, you will still be a rat. There is no one out there that shares your same genetic makeup let alone your life experiences. Escape the competition through authenticity. No one can compete with you on being you.

- **Accept First.** The first step towards getting somewhere is to accept where you are. Next is deciding that you are not going to stay where you are. After that comes the plan.

- **Harbour a beginner's mindset.** In the beginner's mind there are many possibilities, but in the expert's there are few 


#### **Business**

- **You do not have to be the first or only business.** Look around you. A glass, a water bottle, a table, a chair, a notebook. These products have literally thousands of competitors. Often competitors that are pretty much identical. And yet people make glasses, and people make water bottles, and people make chairs and people make notebooks everyday. And people buy all those things too. In other industries, we don't have this idea that you have the be the only water bottle. We don't have this idea that, someone's already invested the water bottle, there can't be another one, but in software, we very often have this idea, of well, there already a social media software.  


#### **Productivity**

- **Perfection is a myth.** Perfection can be enemy of good. Progress is more important than perfection. Make a choice and move on. Just ship. Done > Perfect.  

- **Look out for 90/10 solutions.** Look for a way in which you can accomplish 90% of what you want with only 10% of the work/effort/time. If you search hard for it, there is almost always a 90/10 solution available. Most importantly, a 90% solution to a real customer problem which is available right away, is much better than a 100% solution that takes ages to build.

- **Focus on a few things.** Eliminate things that have little to no payoff. Every minute spent on a task that little or no payoff takes up time, energy, and space that could be put to work for a more important task. Don't let distractions let you half ass things. 

- **Focus on what you control.** Leave the rest to fate. God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, courage to change the things I can, and wisdom to know the difference. 

- **Associate growth with doing.** Not reading/watching/listening. Don’t over study and under execute. You don't learn cooking by reading cooking books. Doing something is better than doing nothing.


#### **People**

- **People are oddly consistent.** If someone treats someone badly it’s only a matter of time they treat you badly. If someone screams over an enemy it is only a matter of time they scream at you.

- **Don't change people.** Don't waste your time trying to change people. Set the behaviour expectation and hold that line. If they don't change, accept and move on.

- **Level up your surroundings.** You are the average of the 5 people who you spend the most time with. Success in your life depends on who you chose to work with. This can be extended beyond people. What books, podcasts, videos do you consume?

- **People are going always judge you.** It doesn’t matter how you choose to live your life — whether you build a business or work a corporate job; have children or choose not to have children; travel the world or live in the same town all of your life; go to the gym 5 times a week or sit on the couch every night — whatever you do, someone will judge you for it. There will always be haters and difficult people. For one reason or another, someone will find a reason to project their insecurities, their negativity, and their fears onto you and your life, and you’ll have to deal with it.

- **Follow the golden rule.** Treat others like you would like to be treated. Be genuine above all.


#### **Money**

- **Know when is enough.** At a party given by a billionaire on Shelter Island, the late Kurt Vonnegut informs his pal, the author Joseph Heller, that their host, a hedge fund manager, had made more money in a single day than Heller had earned from his wildly popular novel *Catch 22* over its whole history. Heller responds, “Yes, but I have something he will never have . . . *Enough*.”


#### **Learning**

- **It is ok to not finish a book.** Don't grind through pages and pages of books. Read what you like. There are more books published every year than you can even read in your entire lifetime. It is ok to quit on a book and move to a different one.  



#### **Moral Values**

- **Do the right thing.** No matter what don't compromise on your ethics. You would not repent it. Always do the right thing. 


#### **Time**

- **Think long-term.** In a world focused on being short term being long term is a competitive advantage. Remember, most benefits of compounding come in the later stages.

- **Both quantity and quality time matter.**  There is nothing like quality time. If you don't have quantity then sometimes you don't have quality too.

- **Have Patience.** No matter how great the talent or efforts, some things just take time. You can't produce a baby in one month by getting nine women pregnant.

#### **Taking care of yourself**

- **Make health your top priority.** There is nothing more important than your health. There is no wealth, no fame, no power without good health. Health precedes everything else.

- **Be an optimist.** Optimism should be your default strategy. Pessimism is intellectually seductive and the arguments always sound smarter. But it leads you nowhere. No one is excited by pessimists. No one wants to really follow a pessimist.

- **Stay away from negative people.** Vibes are contagious. Surround yourself with people who increase your energy and run far away from those who drain it. 

- **Do not hold onto negative criticism.** Critics will always be loud and clear. It doesn’t matter what you do, there will always be someone who finds fault in it. Criticism and negativity from difficult people is like a wall. We are more likely to remember to this negative criticism than praise. And if you focus on it, it you’ll run right into it. You’ll get blocked by negative emotions, anger, and self-doubt. Your mind will go where your attention is focused.  If you're dealing with criticism, then don't let the wall keep you from seeing the road. Focus on the path ahead.   

- **Do not hold grudges.** If you do, it is only going to make your life bitter. Life becomes much easier when you learn to accept an apology you never get. When someone is nasty, rude, hateful, or mean with you, pretend they have a disease. That makes it easier to have empathy towards them which can soften the conflict. Sometimes good people act badly. You continue to do what is right. Release the grudge as if it was a poison. Let it go.
