### About the project
I started this project for Inktober 2016. I'd been learning brush lettering for a while, and I painted a series of pop-culture phrases from things that I love. They're mostly watercolor on paper, with some digital processing to clean up blemishes. Here are a few of my favorites.

> Hello World. As an engineering student turned into a designer, it only seemed fitting to start with this.

> Don't even trip, dawg. From Rick and Morty, one of my all-time favorite TV shows.
