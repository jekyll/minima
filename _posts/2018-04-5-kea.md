Kea is a Voice AI startup that helps restaurants accept phone orders without needing a human to answer the phone and transcribe the order. Their technology directly integrates with Point-Of-Sales (POS) systems, and phone orders show up at the restaurant as tickets similiar to online orders.

I worked with [Kea](www.kea.ai) to develop a brand identity for their startup, marketing material for pitches to early clients, and contributed to the UI Design for their internal and customer-facing websites.

###### The branding leaned towards making Kea feel friendly and efficient, and was pitched as easy to integrate with existing workflows while saving on dull, repetitive labor.

###### The logo uses a red dot to indicate recording, and bold, lowercase typography for a friendly, modern appearance. I designed dark and light versions of the logo in rectangular and square versions for use in different situations.
