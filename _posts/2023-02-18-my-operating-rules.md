Here is how I operate on:


#### **Social Media**

- **I check my social media accounts, once a day between 12-1 PM.** Expect a delay in replies outside of that. If I check my social media account more frequently I develop anxiety and also not able to do deep work. 

#### **Email**

- **I check my e-mails twice a day between 8-9AM and 12-1PM.** Expect a delay in replies if it is outside of that. Checking e-mail more freuqently interferes with my deep work.

#### **Slack**

- **I check my Slack thrice a day between 8-9AM, 12-1PM & 5-6 PM.** Expect a delay in replies if it is outside of that. Checking Slack more frequently than that interferes my deep work.

- **Please @tag me if you need anything more urgently from me. Otherwise of that my notifications are off.** Checking Slack more freuqently than that interferes with my deep work.


#### **Daily Schedule**

- **Start with 750 words.** I believe that writing helps me think. So I usually start my day by doing 750 words. If not at the start of the day I try to do it at the end of day.

- **Exercise in the morning.** I want to exercise in the morning on an empty stomoach. If I push it for later in the day it doesn't work. 

- **Clean up to-do things at the end of the day.** This is not a high mind intensive task and can easily done at the end of the day.

- **Podcasts while cooking and cleaning utensils.** I like listening to podcasts when cleaning and cooking utensils.

- **Read the book at the end of the day.** I like to tend the day by reading a book. It helps me reduce my digital time so helps me sleep better. Reading a book at the end of the day helps me sleep better. 


#### **Tracking Habits**

I use a Google Sheet to track my habits that help me be on track. 


#### **Work on Weekends**

To the extent possible, I try and avoid working on weekends. Sometimes I work on weekends to make sure that my upcoming week is relaxed and I am not stressed out. But too many times I have noticed that when I work weekends I feel burned out. And this even means when I am working in my personal stuff on the weekend which I enjoy I feel burned out.
