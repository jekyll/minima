Here is my operating framework:


#### **Social Media**

- **I check my social media accounts, once a day between 12-1 PM.** Expect a delay in reply for messages or comments that you migth have sent. If I check my social media account more frequently I develop anxiety and it intereferes with deep work. 

#### **Email**

- **I check my e-mails twice a day between 8-9AM and 12-1PM.** Expect a delay in replies if it is outside of that. Checking e-mail more freuqently than that interferes with my deep work.

#### **Slack**

- **Please @tag me if you need anything from me. Otherwise my notifications are off.** Expect a delay in replies if it is outside of that. Checking Slack more freuqently than that interferes with my deep work.

#### **What does my day look like?**

- I believe that writing helps me think. So I usually start my day by doing 750 words. If not at the start of the day I try to do it at the end of day. 

- Reading a book at the end of the day helps me sleep better. 



#### **How do I track if I am sticking to these rules?**
