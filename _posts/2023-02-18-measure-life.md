I've been inspired by Clay Christensen blog titled [_"How Will You Measure Your Life?"_](https://twitter.com/JamesClear){:target="_blank"} and in this post I try to answer that question for myself.



#### **How will I measure my life?**

- Whether I was there for my family when they needed me?

- Whether I was a positive force in the life of people who I touched?

#### **How will I not measure my life?**

- By likes on social media. Likes ≠ money. Being famous on LinkedIn & Instagram is like being rich in monopoly.
