The first time I came to IDC was for my interview was April 2018. I had found a friend of a friend, someone who was soon graduating from the college, and I asked him how his experience at IDC had been. He told me he had learnt a lot, but still sometimes felt like he didn't know nearly enough. I was a bit puzzled by this. I had hoped that two years of design school ought to be enough to feel reasonably confident you knew _something_.

I perhaps understand what this meant now that I have spent two years at IDC There is no end to things one can learn. There is no finish line you can reach and stop. IDC gave me the time, space and direction required to find and learn some things, but it should not be the end of this journey. I am still trying to find ways to do this.

##### A list of things I want to do:
- Make a dent in my reading list
- Do some painting and brush lettering
- Learn to play a musical instrument

##### Some technical skills I want to pick up
- Learn React
- Make a simple CRUD app connected to a database
- Host the app on a server

#### COVID-19 and making plans when nothing is certain anymore

I have barely left my house over the past four months, and it has started to almost feel status quo. One of the most distressing thing about the pandemic for me has been how the future just seems impossible to predict anymore. I have only been thinking of my life in terms of the next few days and every day feels the same: working interspersed by [doomscrolling](https://www.merriam-webster.com/words-at-play/doomsurfing-doomscrolling-words-were-watching) on the internet. My entire world is reduced to rectangular screens through which I do work, meet friends, and find amusement.
