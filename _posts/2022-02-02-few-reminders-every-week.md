#### **Questions you should ask often** 

- Is it good enough?

- Will it move the needle?

- Am I 80% there already?

- What are you grateful for?

- Were your intentions clear?

- Can this be your superpower?

- Is this something that you control?

- Will this matter 30 days from now?

- Is it worth doing given your hourly price?

- What if you are wrong, even a 1% probability?

- Do you enjoy doing it? Does it give you energy?

- What is the 1 big thing that you'll get done today?

- Can you do this consistently? Day after day, week after week?

- If today were the last day of my life, would I be doing what I am about to do today?
