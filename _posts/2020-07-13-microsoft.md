I started my first job as a UX Designer at Microsoft soon after finishing my Master's degree in Interaction Design at IDC School of Design, IIT Bombay. I joined the Canvas Voice team in Noida, which worked on experiences like Dictation, Transcription, Read Aloud and Voice Search across Microsoft apps like Word, Outlook and OneNote.

When I was a nerdy, computer obsessed teenager in school, a few of my nerdy, computer-obsessed friends were part of the school computer club, Exun. Members could hang out in the computer lab and go for inter-school competitions, and so I desperately wanted to join the club. This lead me down the path of learning GIMP, a free and open source graphics editor like Photoshop, and later a variety of video editing softwares so I could make short films. I even dabbled in making some very strange stop-motion films, like this one:

As I spent more time trying to see what I could create with computers, I become something of a go-to guy for designing posters, magazines, or videos. I remained convinced that this was a hobby and once I finished school I went on to study IT Engineering. I wasn't bad at it—my grades were decent, but I found myself stifled by the rigid environment and continued to want avenues to do more interesting things. I kept an eye out for hackathons like [HackIndia](https://gyanl.com/hackindia) (for which I designed the brand identity and social media posts), competitions, and open days by companies like Zomato.

However, I wasn't a programmer or a web designer or a graphic designer, and the yearly
