There are 80 circles in the picture below. Each of them represents a year in your life (assuming a life expectancy of 80 years). For sure, one of those circles represents the year that you are going to die. There is no escaping that. It is the truth. It is a reminder that life is short. It passes by quickly. It is important to live it fully and with no regrets!
