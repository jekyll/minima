It is July 2019. I weigh 82 Kgs. I am obese. I am trying to lose weight now for the 8th year running. Finally something worked.   weighed 82 kgs. I was obese. I no longer am. For the first time in 8 years, my weight is back to normal. 

I am 11 kgs lighter...

This is a post about what I learnt in this journey? 

Before I go ahead, a disclosure. I am neither a doctor, nor a  fitness trainer. I am just a simple guy who lost 11 kgs weight. Take any of what I say with a pinch of salt. 

#### **A simple equation that governs change in body weight** 

*Change in Body Weight = Total Calories In - Total Calories Out*

You lose weight if Total Calories in < Total Calories Out i.e. you take in lower number of calories than you spend. You gain weight Total Calories In > Total Calories Out i.e. you take in more calories than you spend. It's that simple. 


#### **Control your calorie intake** 

- Reduce high calorie food.. Dairy for example.. 
- Now to lose weight, you need to control your intake while increasing the calorie out/burn rate.  Consume foods that have high fibre or high protein. They help you feel fuller for a longer duration. Increase your Protein and fibre Intake. Decrease the amound of carbs in your food.  

- **Cook your own food.** The surest way to control what you eat is to cook it yourself. You can't be 100% sure of the materials or ingredients that someone else puts in your food. Give restaruants food a pass. Cut outside food. You don't know what ingredients do restaurants use.. cut them out.  
- Focus on your diet. Reduce outside foodReduce dairy. Diet matters more than exercise. 
- Few hours before gap. 
- **Try Fasting**

#### **Increase your calorie out rate**

- Increase your metabolism 

- Exercise. 

- Build muscle.

  

#### **Other Tips Motivation Puzzle**

- Long Term. Weight loss for me wasn't a straight line.. there were always uphills and downhill.. it didn't even move for maybe 3 months. It is not a sprint.. it is a marathon. I tried Keto but it was something that I couldn't do for the long term being a vegetarian..

- Consistency. Consistency is the key/ Consistency. Being consistent was key. Be it Diet Consistence in Diet. Consistency in Exercise. I tried losing weight for 6 years.. but soemthing about this year just worked. Maybe it was the pandemic. 


- Exercise that works for you..

- Measure what matters.. Measure your weigjt.. what gets measured gets manager.. everday mesasure.. consistencey check marks.. etc. 

-  Motivation angle 

- Follow a routine. Jess Sims is our favourite insturctor..

What didn't work for me?




Things I was doing wrong? 



In the end, I would be lying if I told you that it was easy. There are no shortcuts. The equation is simple, the work is hard.  

This post is about what worked for me and what might work for you..

For long, I health is a top priority. I outline that in my Inner compass.. wanted to improve my weight.. but couldn't get to it..  untill I stumbled upon this simple equation Jeff Caverliar teached in his workouts.. 

Both my mother, and wife really wanted me to lose weight.. but not any longer.. 

I lost weight because my Calories out was less than Calories In.. There are no magic bullets here.. Every Weight loss technique relies on that simple equitation. 

In the end, what worked for me might not work for you. But give it a try! 

It is not a smooth journey .. there are going to be ups and downs. 



- Me and my wife are huge fans of Jess Sims. She is the best fitness instructor on the planet. I and my wide We start our day with her body-weight strength classes on Peloton are my absolute favourite. Thanks to them and intermittent fasting I have already lost 8kgs this year. In her classes, she routinely shares few words of wisdom Today I wanted to share with you 10 lessons from her workout that are as relevant during the fitness class as much they are in the real world:
- Many of you might have come across the book Atomic Habits by James Clear. James' writing is the gold standard for everything related to habits. 

In his book, James makes the case for [tiny consistent habits](https://jamesclear.com/habits){:target="_blank"} that compound and chan

![Excel sheet that tracks your habits](/assets/img/sample-habit-tracker.png)  

It is an excel sheet that you can use to track your habits. Both I and my wife have been using it for months. It has worked wonders.

#### **3 features worth highlighting** 

Before creating this sheet, I tried many apps to track my habits. Unfortunately, none of them worked. I really wanted my habit tracker to have these 3 features.  

1. **Flexibility —**  Ability to keep track of daily, weekly, and monthly habits. Ability to modify, delete, or add as many habits as you want. Access to the tracker on any device at any time 
2. **Analytics —**  Ability to analyze raw data (eg. hit ratios daily and over time)  
3. **Notes —** Ability to add customized notes on your habits

The excel sheet has all these features. 

1. Make a copy of the [sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xQd2uBECCaiVJLBC5aaMa4lrMl4SHlrrGIJNXu-DYRc/edit?usp=sharing){:target="_blank"}

2. Start by listing down the habits that you want to track

3. Enter the date (preferably a Monday because the sheet also tracks weekly habits) 

4. Enter 1 if you succeeded, 0 if not
