I only picked up my reading habit starting in 2019. I am still playing catch-up for all the lost years where I read almost no books. Here are a few books that I read recently & my 3 key takeaways from them. I am working to add takeaways for a few more.

#### **The Psychology of Money**

>Author: Morgan Housel <br/>
Rating: 5/5 <br/>

**3 key takeaways:** 

1. **Tail events drive the majority of results —** You can be wrong more than half the time and still have superb results in life. A small minority of things account for the majority of results. 
2. **Freedom brings happiness —** The ability to do what you want, when you want, with who you want, for as long as you want, is priceless. It is the highest dividend that you can hope for.
3. **Reasonable > Rational —** Good decisions are not always the most rational. On paper, rational decisions might have an edge but in reality, they might not be the most reasonable. We are humans. We are not  spreadsheets. Reasonability of decisions matters.

#### **The Difficulty of Being Good**

>Author: Gurucharan Das <br/>
Rating: 5/5

**3 key takeaways:** 

1. **Envy has zero upside —** Envy is a great leveller, and it levels all downwards. Instead of motivating one to perform better, envy prefers to see the other person fall. The envious person is willing to see both sides lose. Give up envy.
2. **Neither exploit nor let yourself be exploited —** As a first move try and always be nice to all, including your enemies. Do not be the aggressor. If exploited, make it clear, that you are not willing to be exploited.  
3. **Do what seems just to you —** Sometimes all choices involve serious wrongdoing and there seems to be no right answer. For eg. Is it ok kill a few dictators to save millions of people? There are no easy answers here. The satisfaction of mind is the only authority in these cases. It is your personal conscience based on your inner principles that counts. 

#### **How to Lie With Statistics**

>Author: Darrell Huff <br/>
Rating: 3/5

**3 key takeaways:** 

1. **Ask if the numbers can be faulty?** Don't fall for every number you see. Question it. Challenge it. Ask, can there be any motivation in forging the numbers? Sometimes, the data itself might be biased without any maligned intention.  
2. **Devil is in the detail —**  For example there are 3 types of averages - mean, median, & mode. The statistician might present you an average that suits him/her best. Don't be fooled. Go into the details.   
3. **Correlation is not causation —** If A & B go together that does not mean A caused B. There could sometimes be a 3rd factor causing both A & B.
