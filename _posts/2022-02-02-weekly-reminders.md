Inner compass is a list of ideas that guide me. It is a collection of quotes, summaries, experiences, book excerpts and learnings over time. When I am feeling low, stressed out, in doubt, or have a decision to make I come to this for guidance. The goal is to not to remember everything. The goal is for this document to act as my compass in life. 

Most ideas listed in this internal compass are not mine. They have been borrowed from many authors. I am truly grateful for their work.  This post is work in progress and continues to evolve with my thoughts.

- Do you enjoy doing it? Does it give you energy?

#### **Quotes**

- In the beginner's mind, there are many possibilities, in the expert's mind, there are a few — Shunryo Suzuki

- The man who asks a question is a fool for a minute, but the man who does not ask is a fool for life — Confucius

- Never, ever, think about something else when you should be thinking about the power of incentives — Charlie Munger

- The more you create, the more powerful you become. The more you consume, the more powerful others become — James Clear 

- Yesterday is history, tomorrow is a mystery, but today is a gift that is why it is called the present — Master Oogway

- God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, courage to change the things I can, and wisdom to know the difference — Reinhold Niebuhr

- Would you rather be the world’s greatest lover, but have everyone think you’re the world’s worst lover? Or would you rather be the world’s worst lover but have everyone think you’re the world’s greatest lover? — Warren Buffett


#### **Decision making**

- **It is ok to change your mind.** Ability to change your mind based on existing or new information is a super power. Don't stick on to a bad decision.  

- **Minimize long term regret.** One way to differentiate stuff that matters vs that doesn't matter is to ask yourself if you'll care about it in the future? Fake stuff that matters usually has a sharp peak of seeming to matter in the near term but actually does not matter in the future. 

- **Optimize for speed.** If a decision is reversible, the biggest risk is moving too slow. If a decision is irreversible, the biggest risk is moving too fast. 

- **Have the courage to follow your heart and intuition.** They somehow already know what you truly want to become. 

- **Reduce decision fatigue.** Decision making ability can get fatigued when you use it over and over again. Take the time to plan out, simplify, and automate the repeated decisions. Automating decisions will free up your mental space and give you more time for making important choices.  

- **Analyse decisions.** What did you know before hand? What didn’t you know before hand? What were the range of possibilities and what outcome you expected? What happened? 

- **Make decisions.** There is nothing worse than sitting on decision that needs to made. Get better at it. Give yourself +2 for every right decision, 0 for every wrong decision, -2 for every decision that you don't make. Write down the pros and cons of the decisions and make it. The pain of inaction stings longer than the pain of incorrect action. 

- **Complete it or kill it.** If something is important to you, complete it. If not, kill it. Don't be in the middle. Fill your life with goals that are worth finishing and eliminate the rest.

#### **Living life**

- **Health is your top priority.** There is nothing more important than your health. There is no wealth, no fame, no power without good health. Health precedes everything else.

- **Be an optimist.** Optimism should be your default strategy. Pessimism is intellectually seductive and the arguments always sound smarter. But it leads you nowhere. No one is excited by pessimists. No one wants to follow a pessimist. Over the long term, the future is decided by optimists.

- **Set the agenda.** Or someone else will. If you don’t decide what you want for yourself someone else will. Don’t waste your time living someone else’s life. You need to be proactive with what you want. You are more likely to get it. If you don’t know what you want, you end up with a lot that you don’t. Own your career and your life.

- **Do what interests you.** We get more out of what interests us. The sad reality is that many people don’t enjoy their jobs, nor do they learn much from them. If you combine this with the fact that we spend over a third of our lives working, you have a situation where money is the only reason you are waking up each morning for a long long time. 

- **Be yourself, because everyone else is already taken.** There is no one out there that shares your same genetic makeup let alone your life experiences. Escape the competition through authenticity. No one can compete with you on being you.  

- **Accept First.** The first step towards getting somewhere is to accept where you are. Next is deciding that you are not going to stay where you are. After that comes the plan.

- **Learn from experience**. There is really no substitute for experience. You don’t know what you don’t know. You can read stacks of books, get mentors, take courses, or make the perfect plan. You'll still yourself making mistakes. It’s only when the mistake stings you properly that you learn and don’t forget. The best and quickest way to learn is through experience. 

- **Do the right thing.** No matter what don't compromise on your ethics. You would not repent it. Always do the right thing. 

#### **Mental Models**

- **Start with why.** Explain to others and yourself why is something important? What is the rationale behind your action? Give examples to bring it to life.  

- **Always Invert.** Knowing what you don't want gets you closer to what you want. Each no brings you closer to a yes. A lot of success in life and business comes from knowing what you should avoid eg. bad investments, bad marriage, bad food, bad behaviour etc. Amass long-term advantage by consistently being not stupid. 

- **Learn by doing.** Not reading/watching/listening. Don’t over study and under execute. You don't learn cooking by reading cooking books.

- **Try it out before you go all in.** The only sure way to know that you are going to like or not like something is to try it out. Don't go all in from the very start. For new things, buy a 1 month subscriptions instead of locking in 36 months from day 1.

- **Think long-term.** In a world focused on being short term being long term is a competitive advantage. Remember, most benefits of compounding come in the later stages.

- **Both quantity and quality time matter.**  There is nothing like quality time. If you don't have quantity then sometimes you don't have quality too.

- **When wrong, Apologize.** Don’t justify your actions. Admit that you screwed up. To make mistakes is human. To own your mistakes is divine. Mistakes become harder to correct the longer they linger. Apologize quickly, specifically & sincerely.

- **Control your anger. So it does not control you.** Anger seldom brings you anything good. It obstructs your rational thought process. Don't respond or act when you are angry.  Breathe in. Let it go. Act once your anger subsides.

#### **Productivity**

- **Done > Perfect.** Perfection is the enemy of good. Progress > perfection. Make a choice and move on. Just ship.   

- **Look out for 80/20 solutions.** Get to the 80% output quick. Look for a way in which you can accomplish 80% of what you want with only 20% of the work/effort/time. An 80% solution to a real customer problem which is available right away, is much better than a 100% solution that takes ages to build. 

- **Be consistent.** You need consistency more than you need intensity. Consistency makes for progress. Your 1st blog post will be bad, but your 100th will be great. Your 1st workout will be weak, but your 100th will be strong. Put in your reps. Luck also favours the consistent.

- **Don't overdo productivity.** Don't bleed every last piece of productivity from every second you have to spare. Look around you, all the people who you love will be gone one day, especially the ones who spent their whole lives looking after you, yes you. Think about that once in a while. Spend your time, love, energy, and emotions accordingly.

#### **Money**

- **Never bet the house.** There is a story about a gambler who lost regularly. One day he heard about a race with only one horse in it, so he bet the rent money. Half way around the track, the horse jumped over the fence and ran away. Invariably things can get worse than you expect.

- **Money only solves your money problems.** Not all your problems. A calm mind, a fit body and house full of love can’t be bought. They are things that need to be earned. 

- **Real wealth is not about money.** Real wealth is not having to spend time with jerks. Not being locked into status games. Not feeling like you have to say yes. Not worrying about others claiming your time and energy. Real wealth is about freedom.
  
#### **People**

- **You are the average of the 5 people who you spend the most time with.** . Success in your life depends on who you chose to work with. This can be extended beyond people. What books, podcasts, videos do you consume?

- **Follow up twice.** People forget. They don't think you are serious the first time. Give them the benefit of doubt. Follow-up twice. It’s amazing how often a second try works.

- **People are not thinking about you.**  We spend most of our lives crippled with fear of what other people think of us, when in reality, those other people aren't making judgments on us, but rather, are worried about what we think of them. Do not let the fear of other people's opinion destroy your inner peace.

- **Judge people on the same yardstick as you would judge yourself.**  We judge others by their behaviour. We judge ourselves by our intentions. Don't form opinions on people based on single action. People are more complex than that. Anyone can have a bad day.

- **People are oddly consistent.** If someone treats someone badly it’s only a matter of time, they treat you badly. If someone screams over an enemy it is only a matter of time they scream at you.

- **Don't change people.** Don't waste your time trying to change people. Set the behaviour expectation and hold that line. If they don't change, accept and move on.

- **Stop being everyone’s friend.** Because you just can't. Trying to appease everyone means you appease no one. Consensus is regression to the mean. Trying to appeal to all leads to average.

- **Treat others like you would like to be treated.**  Be genuine above all.

- **Search goodness.** In life you often don’t get what you want, you get what you expect. Go looking for trouble and that’s what you’ll find. Go looking for conflict and you’ll find it. Go looking for people take advantage of you and they generally will. See the world as a dog-eat-dog place, and you’ll always find a bigger dog looking at you as if you’re his next meal. Go looking for the best in people, and you’ll be amazed at how much talent, ingenuity, empathy and goodwill you will find. Ultimately the world treats you more or less the way you expect to be treated. You’d be amazed at how much you have to do with happens to you.

- **Show your work.** The most effective networking strategy has nothing to do with conferences, cocktail hours or cold emails. It is about doing interesting things & sharing them publicly. Like-minded people will come to you. 

- **Stay away from negative people.** Vibes are contagious. The impact of negativity is magnified when we talk about it, no matter what we say. Surround yourself with people who increase your energy. Run far away from those who drain it (Vampires).

- **Do not hold onto negative criticism.** Critics will always be loud and clear. It doesn’t matter how you choose to live your life — whether you build a business or work a corporate job; have children or choose not to have children; travel the world or live in the same town all of your life; go to the gym 5 times a week or sit on the couch every night — whatever you do, someone will judge you for it.  There will always be haters and difficult people. For one reason or another, someone will find a reason to project their insecurities, their negativity, and their fears onto you and your life, and you’ll have to deal with it. Criticism and negativity from difficult people are like a wall. We are more likely to remember to this negative criticism than praise. And if you focus on it, it you’ll run right into it. You’ll get blocked by negative emotions, anger, and self-doubt. Your mind will go where your attention is focused.  If you're dealing with criticism, then don't let the wall keep you from seeing the road. Focus on the path ahead.   

- **Do not hold grudges.** If you do, it is only going to make your life bitter. Life becomes much easier when you learn to accept an apology you never get. When someone is nasty, rude, hateful, or mean with you, pretend they have a disease. That makes it easier to have empathy towards them which can soften the conflict. Sometimes good people act badly. You continue to do what is right. Release the grudge as if it was a poison. Let it go.

#### **Success & Failure**

- **Stack your skills.** If you want to be extraordinary, you have two paths: 1) Become the best at one specific thing, 2) Become very good (top 10%) at three or more things. The first strategy is difficult to the point of near impossibility. Few people will ever play in the NBA or make a platinum album. The second strategy is fairly easy. Everyone has at least a few areas in which they could be in the top 10% with some effort. At least one of the skills in your mixture should involve communication, either written or verbal. 

- **Give yourself the liberty to fail.** Some failure in life is inevitable. It is impossible to live without failing at something. Unless you live so cautiously that you might as well not have lived at all - in which case you fail by default. Most failures are one-time costs. Most regrets are recurring costs.

- **Success comes at a cost.** Everything in life is a trade-off.  Do you want to spend two extra hours at work each day rather than with your kids? Do you want to put your career ahead of your marriage? Do you want to wake up early and go to the gym when you feel like sleeping in? Success in one area is often tied to failure in another area, especially at the extreme end of performance. The more extreme the greatness, the longer the shadow it casts.

- **Do not worry about who gets the credit.** It is amazing what can be achieved if you don't care who gets the credit.

- **Rejection is given.** It is not personal. It is about your product or your application. Carry on until luck finds you. Keep pushing forward.

- **Have Patience.** No matter how great the talent or efforts, some things just take time. You can't produce a baby in one month by getting nine women pregnant.


#### **Learning**

- **Read what you like.** There are more books published every year than you can even read in your entire lifetime. It is ok to quit on a book and move to a different one.  

- **Focus on the learning.** Do not crave or seek early career success! Instead of trying to impress others with your title or your pay, focus on what you learn, who you help and what habits and skills you develop.

- **Teaching is the best way of learning.** If you really want to learn a topic, then “teach” it. Write a book. Teach a class. Build a product. Start a company. The act of making something will force you to learn more deeply than reading ever will.
