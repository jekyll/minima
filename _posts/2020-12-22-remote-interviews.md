#### Recruit the right people
A frequent problem with recruiting people online using tools like usertesting.com is people tend to not answer screener questions very honestly. The way many questions in screeners are framed makes it easy to guess which answers are desirable to the

## During the session

### Keep video on
Participants joining the call from their homes may be hesitant to share their video from their home environment or due to bandwidth concerns. Make sure you turn on your video so that participants can see who they are talking to, and let them know that you are also working from home and there may be some background noises. Doing an interview through a screen makes it harder to read non-verbal cues, so you should set an example that this is an informal chat and encourage participants to turn on their video if they are comfortable.

### Put people at ease
Some people can feel uncomfortable talking to a stranger. A few icebreaker questions can help start off the conversation smoothly. An easy way to do this is to start by introducing yourself, giving a rough outline of what the session will be like—how long it will take.

"Hi! My name is Gyan, and I'm a Designer working at Banana Corp in Delhi, India. Along with me on this call are my colleagues Alice and Bob, who might have some question for you later.

You can let me know if there is any questions you would not answer, and we can move along to the next topic. We will be recording this session." 

### Keep it informal


### Avoid leading questions


### Ask open ended questions instead of yes/no

### Listen!
Many researchers will feel the need to fill in gaps in the conversation. Sometimes allowing for a pause in the conversation will give participants a moment to reflect, and they will be able to say something else. Don't leave an awkward gap in the conversation, but employ active listening techniques ()

A further problem is also that usertesting.com seems to have an over-representation of certain types of people—such as college students looking to make some money.
