### Whoami
An NLP enthusiast and currently a Ph.D. candidate at National Institute of Technology, Silchar, India.
### Educational Background
I did my bachelors in Computer Science & Engg. from National Institute of Technology, Arunachal Pradesh from 2012-2016. After that, I completed my masters from National Institute of Technology, Silchar in the academic years of 2017-2019. During my masters I developed my interest in the field of Natural Language Processing and did my masters thesis on word sense disambiguation using a multi-modal approach. 
### Courses That I Took
I have taken these courses throughout my bachelor's, master's, and Ph.D. combined:
- **Fundamentals:** Design and Analysis of Algorithms, Data Structures, Operating Systems, Compiler Design, Theory of Computation, Networks, Databases
- **Math:** Probability and Stochastic Process, Linear Algebra, Discrete Mathematics, Graph Theory
- **AI/ML:** Machine Learning (NIT, Silchar), Artifitial Intelligence (NIT, Silchar), Natural language Processing (NIT, Silchar), Coursera course on Machine Learning by Andrew Ng, Coursera course on Natural Language Processing with Sequence Model by Deeplearning.ai 

### My Research Interest
Currently, in my Ph.D. candidature I'm focussing upon the Natural Language processing for low-resource languages and Machine Translation (MT) in particular. There exists several challenges in MT task for low-resource languages unlike high-resource languages, most importantly the availability of the parallel data. So, in my work I would like to explore the techniques and methodologies to improve the MT task for these less priviledged languages by exploiting the available data.
